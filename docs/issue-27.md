The measurement of vegetation signatures using remote sensing sources has become a critical way to measure the effects of regional and global-scale drought and agricultural production. It is also useful in distinguishing vegetation in regions, including wild and cultivated varieties. The most common method for this is the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) technique.

The concept of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) lies with the fact that plants have evolved to reflect near-infrared light, where visible light is strongly absorbed by almost all plants in photosynthesis. The measure is thus an index of these two aspects, helping to show how vigorous plant growth is happening in regions. Calibrated results can then be used to estimate vegetation growth and overall biomass, as more vegetation growth will affect the ratio of visible light absorbed and near-infrared light reflected. The most common instrument in relation to NDVI has been moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), which is on board in the Terra and Aqua satellites. Overall, 36 spectral bands are used, giving it a wide range of data capture that covers visible and near-infra red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Littercoin, which is a type of blockchain application developed from OpenLitterMap using geospatial data on litter that is shared among a user group. Users simply upload data about plastic litter they spot where that data is then shared and edited by different users. The littercoin rewards users when they report the location of plastic litter in a location. Littercoin does not have a monetary reward but the intent is to eventually enable a monetary incentive for people to help keep their local area clean from plastic waste.

3. [Optimal siting of electric vehicle charging stations: A GIS-based fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis](https://www.gislounge.com/using-gis-to-assess-the-impact-of-electric-cars/)

The biggest problem with electric vehicles is the fact they require charging but are mobile, making it more complex than simply expanding networks in a given area. One work by researchers interested in this problem has assessed electric cars on recharge networks using a method applying fuzzy analytical hierarchy process, where they looked at 15 criteria, in order to determine what locations might be the best to increase power supply. The technique assesses the criteria and weighs their relevance to the power grid. From this, locations that optimize customer needs but balances electric grid capabilities is determined

## Research

1. [Georgia Tech physicists unlock the secret to perfect wok-tossed fried rice](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/georgia-tech-physicists-unlock-the-secret-to-perfect-wok-tossed-fried-rice/)

Two Chinese-American scholars studied the physical process of Chinese fried rice and filmed five chefs fried rice. According to statistics, it takes an average of 2 minutes to stir-fry rice and stir-fry 276 times, each lasting about 1/3 seconds.

2. [Early Riser or Night Owl?](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/02/25/early-riser-or-night-owl-new-study-may-help-to-explain-the-difference/)

![biological clock of people.](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/clock_card-image.jpg)

American scientists have suggested that some people are used to getting up early for physiological reasons. Their biological clock cycle is 20 hours a day, causing the day to start earlier than others.

3. [Google AI will no longer use gender labels like 'woman' or 'man' on images of people to avoid bias](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-cloud-vision-api-wont-tag-images-by-gender-2020-2)

![gender labels](https://i.insider.com/5e4e72612c24b63a1976bc52?width=700&format=jpeg&auto=webp)

A Google AI tool that can recognize objects in pictures will no longer attach gender labels like "woman" or "man" to images of people.Google said it had made the change because it was not possible to infer someone's gender solely from their appearance. It also cited its own ethical rules on AI, stating that gendering photos could exacerbate unfair bias.

3. [Snipaste](https://www.snipaste.com/)

![Snipaste](https://i.v2ex.co/71Ftp04b.png)

Snipaste is a simple but powerful snipping tool, and also allows you to pin the screenshot back onto the screen. Download and start the application, press F1 to start snipping, then press F3 to paste it as a floating window. That's it!

You can also convert text or color info in the clipboard into a floating image window. Such windows can be zoomed, rotated, flipped, made translucent, and even made click-through! If you are a programmer, a designer or whoever works much time before the computer, you will be surprised how it can help you get your work done more efficiently!
