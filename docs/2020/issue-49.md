Geospatial data is really hard to work with. It requires specialized libraries and file formats as well as an understanding of the arcane art of map projections.

At Vrbo™ (part of Expedia Group™), geography is very important to the business. Geography is the foundation of our search product. Geography defines market competitors and influences optimal pricing. Regulations and tax laws operate within geographic boundaries.

Grid systems are critical to analyzing large spatial data sets, partitioning areas of the Earth into identifiable grid cells. [H3](https://github.com/uber/H3) which is a hashing function that maps points to hexagons.

Hexagons have an identical distance to all neighbours from the central cell.

They're also hierarchical, though not as strictly as the squares and geohashes (meaning points near the edge of a hexagon may map to a different parent even though they have the same hash).

This blog post outlines the technical details of the H3 system (and is the source of the above images)

1. [Computer Vision Recipes](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes)

![](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/raw/master/scenarios/media/cv_overview.jpg)

Best Practices, code samples, and documentation for Computer Vision.

This repository provides examples and best practice guidelines for building computer vision systems. This repository aims to build a comprehensive set of tools and examples that leverage recent advances in Computer Vision algorithms, neural architectures, and operationalizing such systems. Rather than creating implementations from scratch, we draw from existing state-of-the-art libraries and build additional utility around loading image data, optimizing and evaluating models, and scaling up to the cloud. Also, having worked in this space for many years, we aim to answer common questions, point out frequently observed pitfalls, and show how to use the cloud for training and deployment.

As much as it may feel scary to go alone, there are good reasons to consider building a business alone, especially if you are spending a lot of time finding a co-founder.

Reason #1: Speed
Reason #2: Founder disagreements
Reason #3: Lower costs
Reason #4: Taking risks

## Academic

1. [Research Says Solo Founders Perform Better. Here is Why.](https://www.growthclub.online/post/research-says-solo-founders-perform-better-here-is-why)

Solo founders are more than twice as likely to own an ongoing, for-profit venture than two or more founders.

Solopreneurs move faster, avoid the drama of teams falling apart, reduce costs by default, and have an easier time taking risks. That being said, they should be aware of fewer funding opportunities and build their support system.

4. [Why Consulting Is Not For Me](https://medium.com/@karti/why-consulting-is-not-for-me-ffdbe09bb3c1)

As a consultant, I get a view of only a small part of a company's business and problems. I end up starting from scratch with each client, discussing expectations, payment, how we run a project, how progress is communicated and so on.

Instead, I want a long-term engagement where understanding and trust are built up over time, and we can build on top of the foundation we've laid, and I get more and more autonomy over time.

## Comments

1. Capitalism seeks to maximize profits. Once sales cannot expand at the same time, technological progress will inevitably lead to layoffs, and those who are unemployed will become poorer and poorer if they cannot find jobs in time. Those who are still at work are getting busier and busier because they are burdened with more productivity. --[ruanyf](https://github.com/ruanyf/weekly/blob/master/docs/issue-121.md)
