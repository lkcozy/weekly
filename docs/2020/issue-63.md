Indoor Mapping Data Format (referenced throughout this document as "IMDF") provides a generalized yet comprehensive model for any indoor location, providing a basis for orientation, navigation and discovery. In this release, there are also detailed instructions for modelling an airport's spaces, a shopping mall, and a train station.

This release also has an extension model that enables a venue, organization, or even industry to create useful features and validations not available in the current private or public use specification.

Now more than ever, people are working from home, which in turn means that more meetings and calls are being disrupted by those inevitable bursts of ambient noise from pets, kids, spouses, and whatever else is making noise while you're trying to work. It may only be a momentary annoyance for those on the other side. Still, it's mortifying to have that annoyance stem from your own home, especially if the call or video conference is an important one. Luckily, now, there's a solution to the problem of working from home in a noisy household: Krisp, the noise-canceling app that's trusted by telecommuters all over the world.

No matter how hard you try, you can't find a corner of your house that's quite enough for your work-from-home conference calls? Krisp solves that problem by making every part of your home a quiet corner, at least as far as the people on the other end of your calls are concerned. Krisp lets you mute all background noise in your internet communications, with support for more than 800 different apps and counting.

How does it work? **Krisp adds layer between your physical microphone/speaker and conferencing apps, which doesn't let any noise pass through. Krisp creates quiet and clarity by way of sophisticated A.I. technology supported by a Deep Neural Network. Twenty thousand sounds and 50,000 speakers were analyzed in order to create an app that can pick out noise from actual worthwhile sound**, and screen it both coming and going. That's right! In addition to canceling out noise from your own environment, Krisp can also cancel out noise from the people you're talking with even if they aren't using it. This creates an altogether more effective and clear connection between callers.

Concerned about privacy? It's understandable, given that Krisp will have a hand in all your audio and video conferences for the foreseeable future. But since all audio processing is performed locally on your device, there's no risk of monitoring, or of your calls being spied on or recorded through the app.

In the skies over southern California, an airman pitted his dogfighting skills against an AI-controlled opponent that was projected onto his augmented-reality visor.

**Why it matters**: Flight simulators don't replicate all the challenges pilots face in the air — for instance, G-forces — and pitting human pilots against one another in the air is dangerous and expensive. Battling AI-controlled agents in augmented reality could make combat training more effective, safer, and cheaper.

**How it works**: The trial aimed to test the integration of an autonomous fighter agent developed by EpiSci with high-brightness, low-latency, augmented-reality technology from Red Six Aerospace.

- Red Six CEO Dan Robinson, an alumnus of the U.K.'s Royal Air Force, piloted a plane of his own design. EpiSci controlled a simulated Chinese J-20 stealth fighter using a combination of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and rules-based modeling.
- EpiSci's agent previously ran on ground-based hardware in a simulation. The trial confirmed that it ran well on the resources available in the Red Six craft and responded to real-world input from GPS and inertial sensors, Chris Gentile, EpiSci's V.P. of tactical autonomous systems, told The Batch.
- The event also confirmed that EpiSci could limit its agent to behaviors useful for training beginners — "It wasn't kill-at-any-cost," Gentile said — without compromising its ability to react to its human opponent's tactics and errors. The U.S. Air Force plans to begin testing the system for pilot training next year.

The ethical boundaries of military A.I. demand careful navigation. Using machine learning to make training pilots safer may be a reasonable application. Building aircraft that can fight on their own, however, is a different matter. The A.I. community needs to draw bright red lines to ensure that A.I. is beneficial and human. To that end, we support the United Nations proposed ban on autonomous weapons.

A new camera app uses a generative adversarial network to let users look like they're dressed for success while they videoconference in their jammies.

Xpression is an iPhone app that maps facial expressions onto still images in real time, allowing users to stream live video selfies clothed in digital costumes.

**Why it matters**: No more judgement for our rumpled work-from-home looks and untidy bedrooms!

**How it works**: The app uses three deep learning models

- The first model estimates three-dimensional face shapes and expressions from the source video. The second does the same with the target image, whether it be a work of art, an anime character, or a selfie dressed for success. Then a generative adversarial network (GAN) maps the source frames to the target.
- The software works with video platforms including Zoom, Twitch, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. It can also be used to make YouTube videos.
- The app is available to iOS users as a beta version [here](https://xpressioncamera.com/).

Apps like these are a lot of fun, and we're excited to see how they will develop. But they also take us one step further into a world where it is increasingly hard to determine what, and who, is real. Society needs better and more consistent standards for labelling digital fakery.

An arbitrage opportunity in financial markets is a time when you can buy an asset on market A for price X and simultaneously sell the same asset on market B for some Y > X and make a guaranteed profit.
Such opportunities also exist in betting markets such as PredictIt and Betfair.

1. Save Like A Pessimist, Invest Like An Optimist
   --[Morgan Housel](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/save-like-a-pessimist-invest-like-an-optimist/)

2. Littlewood defines a miracle as an exceptional event of special significance occurring at a frequency of one in a million. He assumes that during the hours in which a human is awake and alert, a human will see or hear one "event" per second, which may be either exceptional or unexceptional. Additionally, Littlewood supposes that a human is alert for about eight hours per day.

As a result, a human will in 35 days have experienced under these suppositions about one million events. Accepting this definition of a miracle, one can expect to observe one miraculous event for every 35 days' time, on average – and therefore, according to this reasoning, seemingly miraculous events are actually commonplace.
