The longest single uninterrupted train journey, including transfers, does indeed stretch beyond London and Beijing. Starting from the Portuguese coast, one can travel by train not just into China but also to southern Vietnam, 17 000 km (10 566 mi).

Many of the cheapest countries in which to buy mobile data fall roughly into one of two categories. Some have excellent mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure, so providers can offer large amounts of data, bringing down the price per gigabyte. Others with less advanced broadband networks are heavily reliant on mobile data, and the economy dictates that fees must be low, as that's what people can afford.

At the more expensive end of the list, we have countries where the infrastructure isn't excellent and where consumption is minimal. People are often buying data packages of just tens of megabytes at a time, making a gigabyte a relatively large and expensive amount of data to buy. Many countries in the middle of the list have good infrastructure and competitive mobile markets. While their prices aren't among the cheapest in the world, they wouldn't necessarily be considered expensive by its consumers.

## AI/ML

1. [Packing Robots Get a Grip](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/covariant-launches-from-stealth-to-bring-universal-ai-to-robots-300995185.html)

Robots are moving into a job that traditionally required the human touch. A commercial warehouse that ships electrical supplies deployed AI-driven robotic arms from Covariant, a high-profile Silicon Valley robotics firm. Trained using a hybrid of imitation and reinforcement learning, the new machines are far better than earlier bots at sorting items into boxes.

**Why it matters**: More than half of warehouse logistics companies could face labor shortages in the next five years, thanks to the job's tedium and low wages. Market analysts expect automatons to pick up the slack.

**How it works**: Robots have been picking objects off conveyor belts for years, but they generally handle only identical items. Covariant's approach, which uses a single neural network for all objects, enables an arm equipped with a camera and suction gripper to manipulate around 10,000 different items (and counting). The system can share skills with other arms, including those made by other companies.

- Training starts with attempts at few-shot adaptation. In many cases, the robot can learn from a limited number of attempts, the company told IEEE Spectrum.
- For more intensive training, an engineer wearing virtual reality gear uses hand-tracking hardware to control the arm in a simulated environment. The model learns to mimic the motion.
- The model stores basic movements, then hones them using reinforcement learning in various simulated situations.
- The team then uses behavioural cloning to transfer the robot's learned skills into the real world.

Sleep is your life-support system and Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality, says sleep scientist Matt Walker. In this deep dive into the science of slumber, Walker shares the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep -- and the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't, for both your brain and body. Learn more about sleep's impact on your learning, memory, immune system and even your genetic code -- as well as some helpful tips for getting some shut-eye.

## Resources

1. [macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide)

This guide is a collection of techniques for improving the security and privacy of a modern Apple Macintosh computer ("MacBook") running a recent version of macOS (formerly known as "OS X").

This guide is targeted to power users who wish to adopt enterprise-standard security but is also suitable for novice users with interest in improving their privacy and security on a Mac.

A system is only as secure as its administrator is capable of making it. There is no single technology, software, or technique to guarantee perfect computer security; a modern operating system and a computer are very complex and require numerous incremental changes to improve one's security and privacy posture meaningfully.

## Comments

1. Someone has said that there are two kinds of games in the world. One is a game that pursues a clear goal, such as defeating all opponents and achieving the goal to win the game; the other is a game without a clear purpose, to tell a story or experience roaming in the game. I prefer to roam and explore in the game, such as sightseeing in a strange city. There are no tasks that must be done, there are no obstacles that must be overcome, there is no need to collect anything, there is no need to fight with someone, and I am not worried about which corner will jump out of the enemy. If you see something you are interested in, stop and enjoy it.

In my mind, a good game should be like this: the player is in a story, and the beautiful virtual world makes the story fascinating. It will attract you to stay in it, explore every corner, and wait to know the end of the story. The game process is a trip, interacting with the objects around you, and most of the time, you leisurely explore the environment and wait for the plot to happen.

There will be more and more such games in the future, which is a real-life digital novel. On the surface, you are playing games. Still, you are actually reading a novel, turning yourself into a novel character, experiencing the novel's world, and participating in the plot.

2. Agile has corrupted much of the sw dev industry into believing the most expedient thing equates to delivering maximum value in the shortest time. Architectural considerations have been all but eliminated reducing engineering leverage to near zero.

3. Each deliverable is debt-laden with no sustainable way forward. The result is ballooning cost of delivery, driving a lowering of standards and increased headcount. Nurturing real engineering capability in such an environment is nigh on impossible.
