If GPS can be spoofed, how can we prove that you are where you say you are? XYO is solving this problem by building a network that of devices that independently verify the locations of other devices participating in the network. By creating this network on top of blockchain technology, the system itself will be able to execute smart contracts and provide a traceable confirmed timeline of an object's journey.

With the advent of blockchain-based, trustless smart contracts, the need for oracle services that arbitrate the outcome of a deal has grown significantly. In the XYO Network, the off-chain data source moves around in the real world as a specialized type of oracle the authors call a Sentinel. The goal of the XYO Network is to create a trustless, decentralized system of location oracles that is resistant to attack and produces the highest certainty possible when queried for available data. Users can issue transactions, called "queries" to retrieve a piece of location data on any blockchain platform possessing smart contract functionality.

Aggregators from the XYO Network listen to these queries issued to the contract and fetch the answers with the highest accuracy from a decentralized set of devices that relay cryptographic proofs back up to these aggregators.

Berliner Morgenpost created an [interactive map](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/corona-virus-karte-infektionen-deutschland-weltweit/) that shows the current spread of the virus all over the world. The data team from Berliner Morgenpost created an interactive map showing the current state of the pandemic in each country. Diagrams show the constantly updating figures of confirmed infected, cured, or died from the virus. The charts are dynamically updated as new information is continually flowing in. The data is sourced from Johns Hopkins University CSSE, which aggregates it from WHO, CDC (USA), ECDC (Europa), NHC, DXY (China) and Meldungen der Deutschen Beh√∂rden.

Starlink is a global satellite Internet access project of SpaceX. It plans to launch tens of thousands of small satellites eventually, and more than 500 have been launched so far. This site can view the real-time location of all satellites.

SpaceX provides the satellite launch service, where individuals can purchase the launch service via their website. At present, the earliest available lunch date is June 2020. The launching prices start at the U.S. $1 million for payloads ranging up to 200kg, with additional weight adding \$5,000 per kg to the cost.

This service is mainly aimed at customers who want to launch a small satellite with an insufficient budget. SpaceX carried the customer's satellite through the excess space on the rocket based on its own one-shot multiple satellite technology. In this way, SpaceX can occupy the satellite launch market. Although it's not cheap for individuals, it's the easiest way to launch a satellite with the lowest price.

## AI/ML

1. [Poultry in Motion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tyson-takes-computer-vision-to-the-chicken-plant-11581330602)

![](<https://blog.deeplearning.ai/hubfs/ezgif.com-optimize%20(6).gif>)

Tyson Foods uses computer vision to track drumsticks, breasts, and thighs as they move through its processing plants,

**Why it matters**: Food companies are looking to A.I. to drive down costs amid uncertain market conditions. A.I. and robotics are coming home to roost in the poultry industry and beyond.

**How it works**: Workers in slaughterhouses typically count the packages of poultry parts bound for market, then use hand signals to communicate the totals to another worker who enters the numbers into a computer. Tyson is replacing them with cameras that feed neural networks. The company has installed the system in three U.S. factories and plans to roll it out in its four other supermarket packaging factories by the end of the year.

- The camera system identifies cuts of meat along with inventory codes, while a scale weighs them.
- Workers double-check some of the system's findings.
- Tyson says the system is 20 percent more accurate than the human-only method.

## Research

1. [How to Read a Paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf)

This paper describes the 'three-pass' approach and its use in doing a literature survey. The paper

Researchers must-read papers for several reasons: to review them for a conference or a class, to keep current in their field, or for a literature survey of a new area. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the paper's highlights after five minutes, the article will probably never be read.

You can choose to (a) set the paper aside, hoping you don't need to understand the material to be successful in your career, (b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material or (c) persevere and go on to the third pass
Paper reading skills are put to the test in doing a literature survey

## Tool

1. [InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder](http://www.buildyourmap.com/)

![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2FxsOvtd5xTB-Dlf5_QTAjx5AM_e0FCrmGrWHfQJcxbuEWJFVUEFPjDHbM__n9eeqb5uQ%3Dh900&f=1&nofb=1)

The InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder is an excellent tool for Knowledge Management. You can save text documents and web pages with all formattings and links in your knowledge base and perform a ** full-text search** in it. Since every document is attached as a text note to a mindmap item, you can organize them correctly in a large mindmap. This mindmap is browsable, so you will never lose perspective even with thousands of documents. All items are stored in a reliable **local SQLite database**. The app includes many other outstanding features such as the automatic creation of mindmaps from text documents, the import of Wikipedia articles and Twitter tweets into your mindmap and much more. You can even export your knowledge base as a formatted HTML document. And that's not all. The InfoRapid KnowledgeBase Builder is also a popular flowcharting software. You can either create your flowcharts manually or generate them automatically from pseudo-code. And there are a thousand more things you can do with the program. Once you've tried the program, you certainly do not want to miss it anymore, I promise.
