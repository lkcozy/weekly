1. [Using the World Air Quality Index API to make pollution maps](https://flothesof.github.io/world-air-quality-pollution-maps.html)

This post is using the World Air Quality Index API to make Euro pollution maps in Jupyter Notebook.

The result shows that the european air quality is split in two between West and East Europe, with clusters of worse air quality around industrial areas.

## Tool

1. [MazeBattles]()

![](https://github.com/HenryDavidZhu/MazeBattles.com/raw/master/public/img/screenshot.png)

Built a site using Node.js and Socket.io where users race against each other to solve mazes generated using's Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm. Uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm to solve mazes. Features a single player and one-on-one mode.

2. [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async)

```js
async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results) {
    // results is now an array of stats for each file
});

async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) {
  fs.access(filePath, function(err) {
    callback(null, !err)
  });
}, function(err, results) {
    // results now equals an array of the existing files
});

async.parallel([
    function(callback) { ... },
    function(callback) { ... }
], function(err, results) {
    // optional callback
});

async.series([
    function(callback) { ... },
    function(callback) { ... }
]);
```

Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript.

There are several awesome lists on GitHub that collect and curate the best resources for a specific programming language, framework, platform, etc. This site builds on top of those lists, but only shows repos and lets you filter by category, license, time last committed.

## Resources

1. [Advice to my young self: to succeed in your career, forget side projects and focus on your job](https://manuel.darcemont.fr/posts/focus-on-jour-job/)

Many young programmers like to do some side projects of their own after work. The author recommends **not to do side projects aimlessly, especially not to do what you like, but do those side projects that are directly related to your work.**

Shallow side projects are useful to develop a first opinion about a technology that will need to be confirmed with a more elaborate project.

The best way to dig a new technology is to practice it in your daily job. Youâ€™ll spend seven hours a day on it and will quickly become infinitely more proficient than if you just barely used it on nights and weekends.

2. [LET'S MAKE THE WORST REACT EVER!](https://zserge.com/posts/worst-react-ever)

The author explains how to implement the simplest React, which supports JSX syntax and some basic API. The compressed code does not exceed 1KB. This article can be used to understand the principle of React.

3. [Maslow's pyramid of code review](http://www.dein.fr/2015-02-18-maslows-pyramid-of-code-review.html)

![](https://36.media.tumblr.com/72e7200921159a4374b7fc163fe0f6f2/tumblr_njwlh7rZui1qgj0nao1_400.png)

As in Maslow's pyramid, each layer requires the previous one. It is useless for code that is charging the wrong customer to be readable.

Code should be:

- **Correct**: does the code do what it's supposed to? Does it handle edge cases? Is it adequately tested to make sure that it stays correct even when other engineers modify it? Is it performant enough for this use case?
- **Secure**: does the code have vulnerabilities? Is the data stored safely? Is personal identification information (PII) handled correctly? Could the code be used to induce a DOS? Is input validation comprehensive enough?
- **Readable**: is the code easy to read and comprehend? Does it make clear what the business requirements are (code is written to be read by a human, not by a computer)? Are tests concise enough? Are variables, functions and classes named appropriately? Do the domain models cleanly map the real world to reduce cognitive load? Does it use consistent coding convention?
- **Elegant**: does the code leverage well-known patterns? Does it achieve what it needs to do without sacrificing simplicity and conciseness? Would you be excited to work in this code? Would you be proud of this code?
- **Altruist**: does the code leave the codebase better than what it was? Does it inspire other engineers to improve their code as well? Is it cleaning up unused code, improving documentation, introducing better patterns through small-scale refactoring?
