## GeoSpatial

1. [Edge Computing in the spatial analysis](https://www.gislounge.com/recent-developments-in-spatial-analysis-and-computer-vision/)

One reason why there has been an expanded interest in computer vision in spatial analytics is the development of edge computing, which aims to bring cloud-based system analytics and data closer together to enable faster computation.

Tools such as OpenVINO aim to enable users to have much faster processing of video and other forms of visual data to enable complex computer vision tasks that can auto-detect features and provide information about objects more quickly.

Tasks such as segmentation, object detection, similarity measures between objects, action recognition, depth estimation, and many other tasks are incorporate as models that can be used without having to recreate them. Service tasks could then be accomplished more quickly since they only need training data. They can even be configured to use the Internet of Things (IoT) or other remote technologies that provide data to the service.

2. [geogreeting](http://geogreeting.com/main.html#)

![](../images/issue-19-1.png)

geoGreeting is an exciting website that lets you send any message with letters made up from the aerial view of buildings. Most buildings you will find are located in the US since the author has focused on one country. Finding a building representing a letter when seen from an aerial view with Google Earth is not an easy task. A small community of users now helps find the buildings for this website.

To send a greeting, type the message, and you will be able to see where every building for every letter you type is located on the Earth. The full preview of the message can be seen at the bottom of the website.

## AI/ML

1. [The Five Big Ideas in Artificial Intelligence](https://ai4k12.org/resources/big-ideas-poster/)

![](https://i2.wp.com/ai4k12.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AI4K12poster-5.png?resize=1024%2C662&ssl=1)

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) for K-12 initiative ([AI4K12](https://ai4k12.org/)) is developing (1) national `guidelines` for AI education for K-12, (2) an online, `curated resource Directory to facilitate AI instruction,` and (3) a community of practitioners, researchers, resource and tool developers focused on the AI for K-12 audience.

- (1) [Perception](https://ai4k12.org/big-idea-1-overview/): computers perceive the world using sensors
- (2) Representation & Reasoning: agents maintain representations of the world and use them for reasoning.
- (3) [Learning](https://ai4k12.org/big-idea-3-overview/): computers can learn from data
- (4) Natural Interaction: intelligent agents require many kinds of knowledge to interact naturally with humans.
- (5) Societal Impact: AI can impact society in both positive and negative ways.

2. [Time Series 101](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-101-for-beginners-7427dcfdc2f1)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*AfqHPFyS5tc-9Amn)

A focused on forecasting time series using Machine Learning. For this tutorial, the author uses the Regression Module of an open-source, low-code machine library in Python called PyCaret.

Time series data is data collected on the same subject at different points in time, such as GDP of a country by year, a stock price of a particular company over some time, or your heartbeat recorded at each second anything that you can capture continuously at different time-intervals is a time series data.

`Time series forecasting is predicting the future unknown values. `

Time series forecasting can broadly be categorized into the following categories:

- Classical / Statistical Models — Moving Averages, Exponential smoothing, ARIMA, SARIMA, TBATS
- Machine Learning — Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, or any ML model - with reduction methods
- Deep Learning — RNN, LSTM

## Tool

1.  [OpenVINOv](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/index.html)

![](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/OpenVINO-diagram.png)

OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that solve various tasks, including emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others. Based on the latest generations of artificial neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent and attention-based networks, the toolkit extends computer vision and non-vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. It accelerates applications with high-performance, AI and deep learning inference deployed from edge to cloud.

2. [SvgPathEditor](https://github.com/Yqnn/svg-path-editor)

![](https://github.com/Yqnn/svg-path-editor/raw/master/doc/screenshot.png)

Edit or create SVG paths in the browser

3. [Pap.er](https://paper.meiyuan.in/)

![](https://www.maxiapple.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pap-er-paper-macos-mac-gratuit-2.jpg)

Elegant Wallpaper App for macOS. Deliver fresh and stunning wallpapers every day

4. [Convict](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convict)

Convict expands on the standard pattern of configuring node.js applications in a more robust and accessible way to collaborators, who may have less interest in digging through code to inspect or modify settings. Introducing a configuration schema convict gives project collaborators more context on each setting and enables validation and early failures for when configuration goes wrong.

## Resources

1. [Introduction to Linear Algebra for Applied Machine Learning with Python](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra)

This document contains introductory level linear algebra notes for applied machine learning. It is meant as a reference rather than a comprehensive review. If you ever get confused by matrix multiplication, don’t remember the L2 norm or the conditions for linear independence, this can be a quick reference. It is also a good introduction for people who don’t need a deep understanding of linear algebra but still want to learn about the fundamentals of reading about machine learning or using pre-packaged machine learning solutions. Further, it is a good source for people that knew linear algebra a while ago and needed a refresher.

2. [reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

The repository contains several questions to ask the company during your interview. Remember that things tend to be fluid; re-organizations happen often. Having a bug tracking system doesn't make bug handling efficient, and CI/CD doesn't mean your time to deliver is necessarily short.

3. [Naivecoin: a tutorial for building a cryptocurrency](https://lhartikk.github.io/jekyll/update/2017/07/14/chapter1.html)

A tutorial for building a simple blockchain in TypeScript from scratch, which c will help you understand more of the technical aspects of a cryptocurrency.

## Comments

1. It is much more important to work on the right thing than to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter. Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your tiny handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.
