One reason why there has been an expanded interest in computer vision in spatial analytics is the development of edge computing, which aims to bring cloud-based system analytics and data closer together to enable faster computation.

Tools such as OpenVINO aim to enable users to have much faster processing of video and other forms of visual data to enable complex computer vision tasks that can auto-detect features and provide information about objects more quickly.

Tasks such as segmentation, object detection, similarity measures between objects, action recognition, depth estimation, and many other tasks are incorporate as models that can be used without having to recreate them. Service tasks could then be accomplished more quickly since they only need training data, where they can even be configured to use Internet of Things (IoT) or other remote technologies that provide data to the service.

geoGreeting is an interesting website that lets you send any message with letters made up from aerial view of buildings. Most buildings that you will find are located in the US, since the author has focused on one country. Finding a building that represent a letter when seen from an aerial view with Google Earth is not an easy task. A small community of users now help find the buildings for this website.

To send a greeting, just type the message and you will be able to see where every building for every letter you type is located on the Earth. The full preview of the message can be seen at the bottom of the website.

## AI/ML

## Tool

1.  [OpenVINOv](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/index.html)

![](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/OpenVINO-diagram.png)

OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that solve a variety of tasks including emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others. Based on latest generations of artificial neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent and attention-based networks, the toolkit extends computer vision and non-vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. It accelerates applications with high-performance, AI and deep learning inference deployed from edge to cloud.

Elegant Wallpaper App for macOS. Deliver fresh and stunning wallpapers everyday

4. [Convict](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convict)

Convict expands on the standard pattern of configuring node.js applications in a way that is more robust and accessible to collaborators, who may have less interest in digging through code in order to inspect or modify settings. By introducing a configuration schema, convict gives project collaborators more context on each setting and enables validation and early failures for when configuration goes wrong.

## Resources

1. [Introduction to Linear Algebra for Applied Machine Learning with Python](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra)

This document contains introductory level linear algebra notes for applied machine learning. It is meant as a reference rather than a comprehensive review. If you ever get confused by matrix multiplication, don’t remember what was the L2 norm, or the conditions for linear independence, this can serve as a quick reference. It also a good introduction for people that don’t need a deep understanding of linear algebra, but still want to learn about the fundamentals to read about machine learning or to use pre-packaged machine learning solutions. Further, it is a good source for people that learned linear algebra a while ago and need a refresher.
