1. [Olympus Mons – The Largest Volcano In The Solar System](https://designyoutrust.com/2020/09/olympus-mons-the-largest-volcano-in-the-solar-system/)

Olympus Mons (latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. The volcano has a height of over 21 km (13.6 mi or 72,000 ft) as measured by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). Olympus Mons is about two and a half times Mount Everest’s height above sea level. It is one of the largest volcanoes, the tallest planetary mountain, and the second tallest mountain currently discovered in the Solar System.

2. [arctern](https://github.com/arctern-io/arctern)

Arctern is a fast scalable spatial-temporal analytics framework.

Scalability is key to building productive data science pipelines. To address the scalability challenge, we launched Arctern, an open-source spatial-temporal analytic framework for boosting end-to-end data science performance. Arctern aims to improve scalability from two aspects:

Unified data analytic and processing interface across different platforms, from laptops to clusters and cloud.
Rich and consistent algorithms and models, including trajectory processing, spatial clustering, and regression, etc., across different data science pipeline stages.

3. [OpenAQ live updating maps via MTS](https://blog.mapbox.com/openaq-live-updating-maps-via-mts-6db11f50d066)

The scope of poor air quality caused by fires on the West Coast is incredibly apparent in the open data collected by OpenAQ, This is a massive set of data, all dynamically mapped using the new Mapbox Tiling Service (MTS) that automatically creates custom vector tilesets by providing source data (GeoJSON files) with transformation rules called recipes. These recipes specify how to transform that data. MTS then creates a new tileset with that recipe and publishes it.

4. [Glow Effect: the firefly technique](https://blog.mapbox.com/glow-effect-the-firefly-technique-23eff7297075)

The “glow effect” is a cartographic technique, pioneered by John M. Nelson, and is often referred to as the firefly technique.

1. [The Internet in a Knowledge Graph](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/04/1008156/knowledge-graph-ai-reads-web-machine-learning-natural-language-processing/)

![](<https://blog.deeplearning.ai/hubfs/ezgif.com-optimize%20(1)-3.gif>)

Diffbot, a Stanford offshoot founded in 2008, built a system that reads web code, parses text, classifies images, and assembles them into what it says is the world’s largest knowledge graph, according to MIT Technology Review.

**Why it matters**: A knowledge graph that encompasses the entire internet could reveal a wealth of obscure connections between people, places, and things. This tool could also be useful for machine learning engineers who aim to train models that have a good grasp of facts.

**How it works**: Diffbot’s web crawler rebuilds the graph every four to five days, adding roughly 150 million new subject-object-verb associations monthly. The graph encompasses more than 10 billion entities — people, businesses, products, locations, and so on — and a trillion bits of information about those entities.

- The company uses image recognition to classify content into 20 categories such as news, discussion, and images.
- It analyzes any text to find statements made up of a subject, verb, and object and stores their relationships. Its knowledge graph has captured subject-verb-object associations from 98 percent of the internet in nearly 50 languages. The image recognition tool also picks up implicit associations such as that between a product and its price.
- A suite of machine learning techniques including knowledge fusion (which weighs the trustworthiness of various sources) associates new information and overwrites outdated information, the Diffbot founder and CEO Mike Tung told The Batch.
- The company’s customers can sift the graph using a query language, point-and-click interface, or geographic map (as shown above). The system automatically corrects misspellings and other inconsistencies.

1. [How to improve without receiving feedback](https://zellwk.com/blog/improving-without-feedback/?ck_subscriber_id=170842630)

Feedback comes in many forms. They may not be written or verbal. Feedback is always around. Keep your eyes open and you’ll get them.

- Results are excellent feedback. Results show you the effect. When you see results, you can figure out what caused that result.
- Emotions can also be feedback
- When you don’t have qualitative feedback from others, you can produce more work. When you produce more work, you get more feedback (from results) and you can self-correct along the way.

1. Involution means an organization is unable or unwilling to develop outward, the energy of its members has to be developed to the interior of the organization, or internal overdevelopment.
