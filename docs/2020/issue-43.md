No hands on the wheel, no feet on the pedals: A white Volvo cruises the streets of suburban Shanghai free of human control. The computer system housed in the trunk quickly processes information gathered by a fast-spinning sensor atop the vehicle, calculating how many pedestrians are nearby and predicting which lane the car in front will shift into.

This unmanned car is among the first self-driving taxis — or robotaxis — permitted to carry passengers on the open roads of Shanghai, part of a pilot program from China's dominant ride-hailing platform, Didi Chuxing. Since Saturday, users of Didi's app aged 18 to 70 have been able to sign up for a free test drive.

Currently, Didi's robotaxi service includes a human driver at the wheel, ready to take over in unexpected situations. The robotaxis are equipped with cameras and sensors, which allow them to "see" nearby traffic, as well as monitor a conventional vehicle's blind spots.

Mapping the Amount of Snow on Arctic Sea IceScientists have long monitored Arctic sea ice using remote sensing data, given the importance of sea ice in regulating the Earth's climate and global circulation. Many tools, including drones and multispectral and panchromatic satellite, are used in this endeavour. Nevertheless, ground-based monitoring has generally offered the most accurate data. Even with ground-based monitoring, what has been a challenge is measuring and mapping the amount of snow on Arctic sea ice, given the wide spatial extent of the Arctic and polar regions in general. Recently, scientists have gained better remote sensing data to enable more sophisticated monitoring of our fragile sea ice in the Arctic and potential polar regions using more recent and older satellite systems together.

Snow on top of sea ice plays an important role in the rate in which ice can melt in polar regions. Snow on top of sea ice can limit the growth of sea ice during winter, as it acts to insulate the ice. In the warmer months, however, the snow that melts begins to collect on the surface of the ice in the polar regions. If there is a lot of sun and warmth, that meltwater can absorb that heat and accelerate overall ice melt as water melts through. Therefore, scientists have attempted to know how much snow there is on sea ice, given its role in ice growth and melt.

Amid lingering fears of COVID-19, a "robot restaurant complex" has opened in Foshan's famed Shunde District, serving Chinese fare, hot pot, and fast food to up to 600 patrons. The facility has a seating capacity of nearly 600 diners. It accommodates over 40 robots capable of cooking some 200 dishes from three basic categories: Chinese (including Shunde specialties), hot pot, and fast food. Qianxi Group's other automated restaurants, though similar, don't serve such a wide range of cuisines under one roof. Guests arriving at the pink-and-white restaurant make their menu selections with wide-eyed robot waiters. When ready, the food is delivered directly to their table from a Skyrail system or brought in on a tray. Some robots, such as the burger machine, serve customers 24 hours a day.

2. [Bots Don't Need Social Distancing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/technology/chatbots-quarantine-coronavirus.html)

Downloads of Replika, a chatbot designed to be a virtual friend, have spiked during the coronavirus pandemic, reports the New York Times. The service reported the most significant surge in its three-year history in April.

**Why it matters**: The spread of Covid-19 has left countless people lonely and isolated. Chatbots offer a cost-effective, albeit imperfect, an outlet for social interactions.

**How it works**: Users select the bot's name, gender, and avatar and chat via text or voice. It asks about their day, listens to their problems, and offers advice and affirmations. Users said the app soothes their anxieties and provides an outlet for their frustrations.

AI probably will never make an entirely satisfying substitute for human relationships. In a socially distanced world, though, it can be an essential surrogate.

3. [Image Resolution in Black and White](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03808.pdf)

![](https://blog.deeplearning.ai/hubfs/Obama%203.gif)

Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration (Pulse), built by researchers at Duke University, generates high-resolution versions of low-resolution images. It sparked controversy when it transformed a pixelated portrait of Barack Obama into a detailed picture of a white man.

**Why it matters**: Flawed AI leads to real harm. In January, police in Detroit arrested an African-American man for theft after being misidentified by a face recognition system. Such systems have been shown to misclassify Black people.

**How it works**: Most upsampling models are trained to generate high-res output from low-res input. Pulse creates a series of high-res images progressively optimized to match the low-res source.

- Pulse uses StyleGAN, a pre-trained generative adversarial network, to generate a new image from the original and an input vector.
- The system downsamples the generated image to the original's resolution. Then it compares the two.
- It modifies the input vector based on the differences and repeats the process 100 times to arrive at its final output.
- Human judges scored Pulse's production more realistic than that of four competing models. The computer-based assessment Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) rated Pulse's images higher than those in a database of high-res celebrity portraits.-

Upscaling powered by machine learning is making images sharper on televisions and microscopes. The AI community has a pressing need for tests and audit procedures to ensure that such technology is trustworthy and free of bias.

4. [The Google' vs' Trick](https://medium.com/applied-data-science/the-google-vs-trick-618c8fd5359f)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*nxGAdKPhM0yrQra4S_hKXg.png)

There are three reasons why this trick works really well if you want to understand technology, product or concept better:

- The best way to learn something new is to find out how similar or different it is to things you already know — you might recognize things on the returned list and think 'ah so it's like THAT.'
- It's simple. It takes a few seconds.
- The 'vs' suffix is a strong indication to Google that you want a direct comparison. You can also use 'or,' but it doesn't quite have the same strength of conviction as 'vs,' so Google returns a range of options that are more likely to be off the mark.

## Comments

1. The best way to build a large Internet company is to help people do what they want to do and make things ten times easier. People want to write online, but the barriers to publishing on most websites are so high that they have Twitter. You only need to write a sentence to post it.

   --Evan Williams, Co-Founder of Twitter

2. The people doing the actual work were happy WFH and only getting stuff done. Senior management / C-level types were content, seeing sales figures and general output from afar. Middle management struggled because they had a hard time judging work estimates for tasks and whether people had their butts in seats etc.

3. Mirrors and clocks transformed society, but they're so old that nobody questions them.
   Clocks created a culture of anxiety.
   Mirrors created a culture of narcissism.

4. If the goal is only to reach the finish line, that kind of success is very hollow. The best goal is to reach the finish line with many winners. The more winners you have around you, the more satisfying your success will be.
   -- [Howard Schultz, former CEO and chairman of Starbucks](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/onward/)
