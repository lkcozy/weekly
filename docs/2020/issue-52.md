A strange phenomenon has emerged near Amazon.com Inc. delivery stations and Whole Foods stores in the Chicago suburbs: smartphones dangling from trees. According to people familiar with the matter, contract delivery drivers are putting them there to get a jump on rivals seeking orders.

Someone places several devices in a tree located close to the station where deliveries originate. Drivers in on the plot then sync their phones with the ones in the tree and wait near an order pickup. According to experts and people with direct knowledge of Amazon's operations, the reason for the odd placement is to take advantage of the handsets' proximity to the station, combined with software that continually monitors Amazon's dispatch network, to get a split-second jump on competing drivers.

SpaceX confirmed during the webcast of its latest launch on Monday that employees tested Starlink's latency and download speeds, critical measures for an internet service provider.

The results show super-low latency and download speeds greater than 100 [megabits] per second. That means our latency is low enough to play the fastest online video games and our download speeds are short enough to stream multiple HD movies at once.

Starlink is the company's ambitious plan to build an interconnected network of about 12,000 small satellites in low Earth orbit.

1. [Credit Where It's Due](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.17301.html)

![](https://blog.deeplearning.ai/hubfs/Visa.gif)

A neural network helps credit card users continue to shop even when the lender's credit-approval system goes down.

Visa developed a deep learning network that analyzes individual cardholders' behaviour in real-time to predict whether credit card transactions should be approved or denied. The system can step in when a card issuer — generally a bank that typically would vet such transactions — suffers a network outage that makes it impossible to assess creditworthiness.

**Why it matters**: Unlike fraud detection, this model touches cardholders directly to improve the customer experience. It points the way toward public-facing models that personalize banking, credit, and other financial arrangements.

**How it works**: If a cardholder's purchases are blocked, they might switch to another card, costing the bank revenue and possibly a customer. And if a miscreant tries to commit fraud, the bank stands to lose money. So Visa provides a backup system that predicts the decision in case the lender can't go due to software glitches, severe weather, or routine maintenance.

- The new model is trained on the company's database of historical transactions. It learns an individual's typical behaviour based on factors like spending history, location, and transaction timing.
- In tests, it matched banks' decisions with 95 percent accuracy. According to a Wall Street Journal report, an earlier, rule-based algorithm was half as accurate.
- Visa plans to make the service available for a fee starting in October.

**The Results**: The financial industry's health depends on trust. That should provide ample incentive to define the fairness of automated systems in lending and other financial services. Efforts such as Singapore's Principles to Promote Fairness, Ethics, and Transparency are an essential step.

## Comments

1. Users don't like things being taken away. The takeaway is you need to understand what your users want — it's not that easy, and sometimes you will get that information the hard way, but you need to be willing to listen regardless.

2. My decision to leave is neither a financial nor a relational one. I decided to go because I got stuck; there wasn't any room to grow anymore. The perspective of being a developer who's 5 years behind modern-day practices made me miserable.

3. Apple won't let movie villains use iPhones on camera. Every single filmmaker who has a bad guy in their movie that's supposed to be a secret wants to murder me right now.
