Rangers from Big Life Foundation watched the small dot move across their screen: Jenga, a 31-year old male elephant wearing a GPS tracker, was on the move. Using their [EarthRanger](https://earthranger.com/) system, the rangers carefully followed the elephant's progress through a protected wildlife corridor linking Kenya's Amboseli National Park and Tsavo National Park to make sure he avoided areas that could bring him into conflict with humans.

EarthRanger is a data platform for protected areas. It collects, integrates and displays all historical and real-time data from a protected area—wildlife, the rangers protecting them, spatial information, and other threats. EarthRanger empowers protected area managers and rangers to take immediate, proactive actions to prevent and mitigate threat incidents.

2. [Marketing and Rebranding GIS](https://www.gislounge.com/marketing-and-rebranding-gis-opportunities-for-gis-professionals/)

Pitching GIS to organizations GIS professionals are in, and the ones they want to join may mean that such specialists will have to emphasize more than just their GIS skills. Seeing your role beyond only making maps to someone who brings added value to an organization will be essential to make GIS better known while also advancing your career. Developing technical skills and communication skills and diverse experience can aid your career and help advance the utility of GIS for organizations.

How to Market GIS to Your Organization

- Focus on what the technology can do for the business, not the technology itself
- Use location to solve problems, and communicate ideas
- Communicate and develop how organizations see GIS

How GIS Professionals Should Market Themselves

- Your hard skills are important when applying for an entry-level position focus on those.
- For senior and specialists positions, pitch your projects as well as your deep technical understanding
- Management positions require proven communication skills and a focus on strategic goals

The MapScaping Podcast is a weekly podcast featuring interesting people doing amazing work in the geospatial world. During each podcast, they interview experts and feature people that will help you learn more about GIS, geospatial, remote sensing and earth observation.

## AI

1. [AI Beach Life Saving system](https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/26/sightbit-deploys-ai-on-beaches-to-help-lifeguards-spot-distressed-swimmers/)

Sightbit deploys AI on beaches to help lifeguards spot distressed swimmers.

**Why it matters**: Drowning is the third leading cause of accidental death, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, with an estimated 320,000 fatalities globally. While lifeguards play a crucial role in safeguarding beaches and pools, the human eye struggles to spot swimmers in distress in large crowds or at a distance — with or without the help of binoculars. Sightbit is harnessing AI to alert lifeguards to potential drowning incidents and flagging other hazardous situations, such as unattended children and rip currents.

**How it works**: Sightbit augments standard off-the-shelf cameras with the software it says is based on deep learning and computer vision technology, with convolutional neural networks for object detection. Sightbit's system rates sections of a beach using a risk assessment model that considers crowdedness and weather conditions and then estimates how many lifeguards are needed on a given day. The system issues real-time alerts for things like swimmers who appear to be struggling, while predictive analytics can help lifeguards anticipate risk and take preventative actions.

**The Results**: A single camera can be stretched to cover roughly 1,000 feet (300 meters) of shoreline, though an area this size is typically covered by three cameras. Sightbit warnings appear as flashing boxes around individuals and hazards. The lifeguard can click on the alert, and then the program zooms in and sees exactly where the alert is.

3. [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/)

![](https://uptime.com/media/website_profiles/brilliant.org.png)

Brilliant creates a culture of learning around inquiry, curiosity, and openness to failure. All of our courses are written with these principles of learning in mind.

In school, people are often trained to apply formulas to rote problems. But this traditional approach prevents a deeper understanding of concepts, reduces independent critical thinking, and cultivates a few useful skills.

The capacity to think critically separates the great from the good. We can grow this capacity by trying — and often failing — to solve diverse, concrete problems.

- Start with simple questions and stories that build your foundation and intuition.
- Ramp up to solving problems that seemed beyond your ability.
- Study different ways of solving the problems that are out of your grasp.

## Comments

1. Mapbox gives us powerful tools and APIs right out of the box, and the freedom to design and create highly specialized solutions. WebGL-accelerated rendering means we're well-positioned for the next generation of high resolution tracking devices, enabling us to design new and inventive solutions.

2. I read the email. I read email; I write an email, I do no coding at all anymore.

Most of the code I write, I actually write inside my mail reader. So somebody sends me a patch, or more commonly they send me a pull request or there's a discussion about the next pull request, and there's something I react to and say, 'No, this is fine, but...' And I send out pseudocode, or — I'm so used to sending out patches that I sometimes edit patches and send out the patch without having ever compiled it, ever tested it, because I literally wrote it in the mail reader, and saying 'I think this is how it should be done.' But this is what I do. I'm not a programmer any more.

I read a lot more email than I write, because what my job really is — in the end, my job is to say no. Somebody has to be able to say no to people. Because other developers know that if they do something bad, I will say no. They hopefully, in turn, are more careful. But in order to be able to say no, I have to know the background. Because otherwise I can't do my job. So I spend all my time, basically, reading email about what people are working on... It is an interesting job, but you do end up spending most of your time reading email.

On the developer side, what I hope people are doing is trying to make, not just good code, but these days we've been very good about having explanations for the code. So commit messages to me are almost as important as the code change itself. Sometimes the code change is so obvious that no message is really required, but that is very very rare. And so one of the things I hope developers are thinking about, the people who are actually writing code, is not just the code itself, but explaining why the code does something, and why some change was needed. Because that then in turn helps the managerial side of the equation, where if you can explain your code to me, I will trust the code...

A lot of open source, in general, is about communication. And part of it is the commit messages, part of it is just the email going back and forth. Communicating what you're trying to do or communicating why something doesn't work for you is really important.
