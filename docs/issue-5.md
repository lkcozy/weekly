United States government scientists on Thursday confirmed that July 2019 was the hottest month on record, edging out the previous record-holder, July 2016. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the global average temperature last month was 16.7 degrees Celsius. That is 0.03 degree Fahrenheit higher than July 2016, and 0.94 degrees higher than the average for the 20th century.

FlightMapper, which is based on deck.gl, offers an elegant way to design and create the aviation map. It allows you to input the origin, destination, date, and airline of your as many trips as you like. You are able to design your flight map based on an array of pre-designed map styles and themes. FlightMapper also provides analytics on total miles, airlines, and airports. It not only enables you to visualize your flying history but also let you share your travel history with your friends and family.

Both figures above may look like colour pictures upon first glance. They're actually black-and-white photos with thin colour grid lines overlaid on it to trick your brain into filling in the missing colour.

According to the creator Øyvind Kolås, this is because that luminance is a lot more important than the chroma for our visual perception.

# Comments

One of the coolest things about programming is that you really get two specialties or more. You get to learn about computer science, and programming, and things like that, but you also always are applying it in a domain. And unless you're a compiler writer or a theorem prover writer, you're going to have some other domain.

I think programmers -- especially young programmers -- they use far too much of their brainpower on programming stuff. Learning the idiosyncrasies of a programming language, learning some really arcane type system stuff, or tons of details about some gigantic Javascript UI library du jour, and not nearly as much time on the domains in which they operate.

In the early years of the commercial web, we were all Web Designers.

In more complex websites and information-heavy systems, the web designer would pair with an Information Architect to make sure content was organized in a way that made sense for that particular audience.

Interfaces then evolved, and interactions became more sophisticated, soon to be followed by the advent of smartphones and touch interfaces. It was the era of the Interaction Designer.

We then moved into experiences that existed way beyond a single screen or flow. The vision of users transitioning across multiple touchpoints in a seamless and connected experience has brought attention to a new figure in the digital product design ecosystem: the UX Designer.

UX Designers has distanced themselves from aesthetic decisions to be able to focus on how things work.
