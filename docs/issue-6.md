Trase.earth provides an open-access information platform for tracing the international flow of agricultural commodities. At the heart of Trase is a beautiful, interactive sankey diagram that visualizes the journey soy and beef takes before arriving on your plate. This makes it possible to follow how sourcing patterns and trade flows have evolved over a period. It can help us to explore what factors might be driving those changes and identify new opportunities to improve sustainability.

These data are now available on the Trase data portal free of charge, so researchers and analysts can use for their own work.
