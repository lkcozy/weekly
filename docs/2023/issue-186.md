This article presents six geospatial programming projects that can help beginners improve their skills. Each project has suggested tools, prerequisites, and learning resources. The projects cover topics such as earth observation, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification, Cloud Optimized Geotiff, Copernicus constellations, map tiling, QGIS plugins, web GIS, and time series mapping using open satellite images. The article aims to make geospatial programming fun and practical by providing hands-on projects that can help beginners gain practical development skills and build their portfolio and resume.

This article provides an overview of WebGIS, which is an advanced form of Geographic Information Systems available on web platforms. It explains what WebGIS is, how it works, and its applications. The article also discusses the tools, technologies, and frameworks used for WebGIS and focuses on Free and Open-Source Software for Geospatial Applications.

Bark is a transformer-based text-to-audio model created by Suno. Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio - including music, background noise and simple sound effects. The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughing, sighing and crying.

2. [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)

![](https://img.hellogithub.com/i/ZmjC3nFwgyuGiT0_1682573184.gif)

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) produces high quality object masks from input prompts such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate masks for all objects in an image.

3. [Next.js OpenAI Doc Search Starter](https://medium.com/artificial-corner/bye-bye-chatgpt-ai-tools-better-than-chatgpt-but-few-people-are-using-them-eac93a3627cc)

This starter takes all the .mdx files in the pages directory and processes them to use as custom context within OpenAI Text Completion prompts.

## Research

1. [Typst](https://typst.app/)

![](https://typst.app/assets/images/mockup-medium.webp)

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system for the sciences. It is designed to be an alternative both to advanced tools like LaTeX and simpler tools like Word and Google Docs. Typst is a browser-based platform that supports collaboration on documents among teams through shared workspaces

## Tool

1. [Word & chatGPT](https://github.com/Kuingsmile/word-GPT-Plus)

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96409857/233878627-6b5abdfd-7ff6-4818-8b26-d78f74ea0e85.gif)

Word GPT Plus is a word add-in which integrates the chatGPT model into Microsoft Word. It allows you to generate text based on the text you have written in your document. You can use it to translate, summarize, polish or even write a whole document from zero.

2. [ReceiveSMS](https://www.receivesms.io/)

Unclutter is a modern reader mode and article library for your browser.

## Resources

1. [A Career Cold Start Algorithm](https://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start)

Entering a new domain and feeling the pressure to provide value is a real pain. It can happen when you join a new company or manage a new team, or as Boz writes, "I’ve joined a team whose work was already well under way, where I had a massive knowledge deficit, and didn’t have pre-existing relationships. None of those excuses relieved me from the pressure I felt to establish myself and contribute." -- follow his advice on structuring 30-minute meetings with relevant members to learn who else to talk with and the topics to cover.

2. [18 Key Design Patterns Every Developer Should Know](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/118124214/key-design-patterns-every-developer-should-know)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63fceee3-327d-4db5-a8ba-c2362a42971b_1421x1536.jpeg)

Patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems, resulting in a smoother, more efficient development process. They serve as blueprints for building better software structures. These are some of the most popular patterns:

- Abstract Factory: Family Creator - Makes groups of related items.
- Singleton: One and Only - A special class with just one instance.
- Adapter: Universal Plug - Connects things with different interfaces.
- Proxy: Stand-In Actor - Represents another object, controlling access or actions.
- Iterator: Collection Explorer - Accesses elements in a collection one by one.
- Observer: News Broadcaster - Notifies classes about changes in other objects.
- Decorator: Customizer - Adds features to objects without changing their core.
- Composite: Tree Builder - Forms tree-like structures of simple and complex parts.
- Bridge: Function Connector - Links how an object works to what it does.

3. [How does Docker work?](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/118124214/how-does-docker-work)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d6cfde-1ff5-4f51-ae35-a56040befa57_1280x1617.jpeg)

A comparison of Docker-based and non-Docker-based development is shown above. With Docker, we can develop, package, and run applications quickly.

- The developers can write code locally and then build a Docker image and push it to a dev environment.
- The above process can run incrementally when bugs are found or improvements are needed.
- When dev testing is complete, the Docker image is pushed to the production environment (often on the cloud).

Compared with traditional development without Docker, Docker is quite lightweight and fast, because only the changed part of Dockerfile is rebuilt every time we make a change.

## Comments

1. When people claim LLMs will replace software engineers, it either indicates a lack of understanding of LLMs or a lack of understanding of software engineering...

2. Most people write to sound smart when they should write to be useful. Communicating to sound smart lowers your potential for impact. The harder people have to work to understand you, the less they want your input.Writing to be useful means writing what you would want to read. Simple, but not easy.

3. The public has a distorted view of science because children are taught in school that science is a collection of firmly established truths. In fact, science is not a collection of truths. It is a continuing exploration of mysteries.

4.What makes life mean something is purpose. A goal. The battle. The struggle. Even if you don’t win it.
