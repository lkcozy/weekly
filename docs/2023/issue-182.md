## Resources

1. [Treat your to-read pile like a river, not a bucket](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/river)

The article argues that information overload is not a problem of filter failure, but of too many needles: too many things that we want to read or do, but don’t have enough time for. The author suggests that we need to accept this problem as insoluble and focus on what matters most to us.

2. [Coding is the easy part](https://swizec.com/blog/coding-is-the-easy-part/)

The author talks about how coding is just one part of a project and how real-world projects are not like tutorials where you start at the beginning and code your way to the end.

3. [Why Engineers Need To Write](https://www.developing.dev/p/why-engineers-need-to-write)

The document argues that writing is a crucial skill for software engineers because it helps them collaborate, scale, and think better. The author shares his personal experience of how writing became a significant part of his work and how it improved his effectiveness. He also gives an example of a friend who uses writing to create a useful wiki for his team. He dismisses the concern that AI tools may make writing obsolete, and claims that writing enhances critical thinking and idea generation. He concludes by stating that the strongest engineers are excellent technical writers.

## Comments

1. Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.

--[Maria Robinson](https://fs.blog/brain-food/april-2-2023/)

2. Few things are more important in life than avoiding the wrong people. It's tempting to think that we are strong enough to avoid adopting the worst of others, but that’s not how it typically works. We unconsciously become what we’re near. The changes are too gradual to notice until they’re too large to address.

3. Those who seek to suppress disinformation may be destined, themselves, to sow it.

--[Megan Stack](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/opinion/covid-lab-leak-theory-disinformation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)

4. Reading won't be obsolete till writing is, and writing won't be obsolete till thinking is.
