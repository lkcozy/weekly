Zero degrees latitude is the line designating the Equator and divides the Earth into two equal hemispheres (north and south).

There is a fictional island known as Null Island at zero latitude and zero longitude. Although it’s not clear when the concept of Null Island was conceived, it came to prominence with the release of public domain Natural Earth GIS data.

3. [There are a lot of things you don’t control](https://fs.blog/brain-food/november-12-2023/)

You don’t get to pick your parents.
You don’t get to pick the country you are born in.
You don’t get to pick your given talent.
You don’t get to pick the test.

You don’t control where you start, but you can change where you go.

Integrity is a choice.
Kindness is a choice.
Hard work is a choice.
Preparation is a choice.
Consistency is a choice.
Your attitude is a choice.
Your response is a choice.
The people you hang around are a choice.
Changing your trajectory is a choice.

## Comments

1. Before you work harder on something, identify the leverage point. Working smarter is the most valuable form of working harder.

2. A kind person will tell us what holds us back, even when it’s uncomfortable. A nice person avoids giving us critical feedback because they’re worried about hurting our feelings.

3. You aren't rewarded for hard work. You're rewarded for creating something of value. So don't work unnecessarily hard on something that you haven't validated people want. Instead, run small experiments over & over again until you have a few strong outcomes. Then double down.

4. The best way to open people's minds isn't to argue with them. It's to listen to them. When people feel understood, they become less defensive and more reflective—and develop less extreme, more nuanced views. Productive disagreements begin with curiosity, not persuasion.
