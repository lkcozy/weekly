## Resources

1. [Three Common Interview Practices](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/bad-interview-practices)

The article discusses some bad interview practices that can lead to poor candidate experience and missed hiring opportunities.

The article recommends that interviewers should focus on asking relevant and open-ended questions that allow candidates to showcase their skills and personality, and provide feedback to candidates regardless of whether they are hired or not.

Instead of asking overused questions, come up with interview questions that are original and better suited to the skills your team needs for the jobs they do.

- Great engineers have strong problem-solving skills and can think critically and creatively to find effective solutions.
- They possess a deep understanding of technology and are consistently updating their skills and knowledge.
- They make the code they own or touch simpler, clearer, easier to work with and faster to change. They do this out of habit, and continuously. They help their team, and those around them do the same.
- They help others be great.
- Effective communication skills are crucial, as great engineers can explain complex technical information to others and work collaboratively with other team members.
- They have a passion for learning and self-improvement, are open to feedback, and are always seeking ways to enhance their skills.
- Great engineers have a strong work ethic and are highly motivated to achieve their goals, with a willingness to work independently and take ownership of their work.

## Comments

1. People think freedom is the power to change what you dislike about the world. You can quit a job you hate. Leave a person who hurts you. Switch cities for new scenery. Chop your hair for a new look. What freedom is: the power to change what you dislike about yourself.

2. Developing a social product is not a technical issue. It's a marketing, political, and social problem. Facebook and Twitter have vast numbers of users who are not at all technical. How you reach people like that and get them to join is your problem, and it has nothing to do with a deep understanding of the technology.
