Geographic information systems (GIS) can help local governments to better manage infrastructure and assets by visualizing data through a geographic form.

This could include:

- Constructing and managing road networks
- Analyzing land use for infrastructure planning
- Identifying areas for waste disposal and stormwater management
- Analyzing environmental conditions
- Tracking assets for maintenance and repair

As a local government, utilizing GIS can help you better communicate that data through a visual component.

Placemaker is a tool to allow users to draw accurately on a map, without the need to download complicated software or have prior GIS experience. Placemaker allows Digventures to present a series of reference layers of data (LiDAR, an historical map, and existing HER datasets) on a map, and makes drawing accurate shapes on the map as easy as using something like Microsoft Paint.
