This webpage is about the OGC API Common Part 1 Core Standard, which provides fundamental rules for implementing a Web API that conforms to OGC design parameters. The Standard establishes rules for the use of HTTP protocols and Uniform Resource Identifiers regardless of the resources being accessed. It enables discovery operations directed against a Web API implementation such as identifying the hosted resources defining conformance classes and providing both human and machine-readable documentation of the API design.

2. [China Exports Market 2022](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/chinas-exports/)

The webpage explains that the value of China's merchandise exports has grown significantly since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. The growth was interrupted by the 2008 financial crisis and slowed until 2020, but then skyrocketed by 30% in 2021 and reached an estimated $3.6 trillion per year by the end of 2022. This means that China's exports alone are bigger than the entire economies of countries like the UK, India, and France.

3. [Artificial intelligence and visual analytics in geographical space and cyberspace: Research opportunities and challenges](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825223001277)

This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with the relationship between geographic and cyberspace, particularly in the context of data analytics and visualization. The paper highlights the potential for synergies between the processing and analysis of geographical and cyber data to improve sustainability and solve complex problems with geospatial applications and other digital advancements in urban and environmental sciences.

The paper suggests several future directions for research, including the development of spatial data models that efficiently incorporate geographical space and cyberspace in and integrated framework to support the development of Geo visualization capabilities and Geo AI analytics.

4. [Advances in geocomputation and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) for mapping](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156984322300122X)

This paper provides an overview of the applications of geocomputation and GeoAI in mapping, categorizing items into four categories: buildings and infrastructure, land use analysis, natural environment and hazards, and social issues and human activities. It also summarizes geospatial and Earth data in case studies into seven categories, including in-situ data, geospatial datasets, crowdsourced geospatial data, remote sensing data, photogrammetry data, LiDAR, and statistical data.

The paper highlights the need for more research on the interpretability of GeoAI models, multi-scale data integration, and spatially explicit models.

Spatially explicit models are models that incorporate spatial information into their analysis, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the spatial patterns and relationships within a given area. These models consider the location and spatial relationships of different features and variables, and can be used to analyze and predict spatial phenomena such as land use changes, natural hazards, and urban dynamics.

This paper investigates how software developers can improve their work habits and productivity by setting goals and pursuing actionable strategies. The study shows that purposeful, continuous self-reflection can increase developers' awareness about their work habits and lead to positive self-improvements.

- improve time management
  - plan: maintain personal task list
  - make progress on most important tasks first: review priorities & reflect on progress towards goals
  - create subtask
- avoid (self-induced/external) deviation from planned work
  - better handle urgent issues: review priorities & plan buffers
  - improve focus: set limits & focus on single task & block apps/websites
- improve impact on the team
  - be a better colleague: share knowledge/findings
  - do more code reviews: develop a routine
  - keep documentation updated: document findings & learnings
- maintain work-life balance
  - at work: stay motivated and fresh
  - outside of the work: better detach from work
- learn
  - learn/improve specific development technology/transferable skill
  - improve myself: reflect on progress towards goals/tasks

## Comments

1. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

2. If someone admits they made a mistake, have the grace to let it go.Holding it over them ensures they won’t be quick to admit they were wrong in the future. Outcome over ego.
