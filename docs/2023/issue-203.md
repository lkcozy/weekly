## Comments

1. Closed-minded people tend to ignore or gloss over anomalies. Open-minded people want to dive in and understand. Of course, diving in is hard as it may require you to discard your ideas and beliefs.
   --[The Difference Between Open-Minded and Closed-Minded People](https://fs.blog/open-closed-minded/)

2. Give yourself a lot of shots to get lucky’ is even better advice than it appears on the surface. Luck isn’t an independent variable but increases super-linearly with more surface area—you meet more people, make more connections between new ideas, learn patterns, etc.
   --[Sam Altman](https://fs.blog/brain-food/september-3-2023/)

3. Focusing on what matters requires continuous effort.It’s easy to overestimate the importance of winning the moment and underestimate how it can cost you the ultimate goal.It’s a daily battle to focus on your ultimate goal, not the quick wins that lead to nowhere you want to go.
