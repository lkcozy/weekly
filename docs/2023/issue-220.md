1. [Discussion vs Conclusion: Researcher's Compact Guide](https://typeset.io/resources/discussion-vs-conclusion/)

- Discussion: explore and interpret findings, analyze data, discuss implications, and compare with existing literature
- Conclusion: summarize key findings, provide a clear and concise summary of the study's main outcomes, and answer research questions or hypotheses

## Discussion

The discussion section is where you interpret and explain your research findings. It'a section for you to explore the implications of your results, compare them to previous research, and address any limitations in your study.

One of the main purposes of the discussion section is to answer the research question. You should provide a detailed explanation of the results and how they relate to your hypothesis or research question.

### Discussion section structure

- restatement of the research **problem**
- summary of the main **findings**
- **interpretation** of the results
- **comparison** with previous research
- **explanation** of any unexpected findings or discrepancies
- discussion of the **implications** of the results
- identification of **limitations** and **suggestions** for prospective research

## Conclusion

The conclusion section is where you summarize your research and its implications. Unlike the discussion section, the conclusion is not the place for a detailed analysis of your results. Instead, it's where you wrap up your argument and leave the reader with a clear understanding of your research and its significance.

The conclusion should provide a succinct summary of your research question, methods, results, and main findings. It should also discuss the broader implications of your research and suggest areas for future study.

### Conlcusion section structure

- restatement of the research **question**
- summary of your main **findings**
- discussion of the **implications** of the research
- **suggestions** for future research

1. [What is API Gateway](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/139972250/what-is-api-gateway)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82be2aaf-c292-481e-b8d5-d47cbe9e64d7_1243x1600.png)

In a microservices architecture, an API gateway acts as a single entry point for client requests. The API gateway is responsible for request routing, composition, and protocol translation. It also provides additional features like authentication, authorization, caching, and rate limiting.

The API gateway differs from a load balancer in that it typically operates at the application layer to handle HTTP requests and understand message payloads, while traditional load balancers work at the transport layer to handle TCP/UDP connections (IP and port numbers) without looking at the application data.

2. [Scaling an Engineering Org: A Journey Through Roles and Responsibilities](https://nothingventured.rocks/scaling-an-engineering-org-a-journey-through-roles-and-responsibilities-b979dabba106)

Challenges

- Ambiguity
  - Clarity matters: lack of clarity on expectations for various roles led to daily challenges. Communication became harder when we didn't know who was responsible for doing what (in particular the EM/PM where lots of things overlap).
  - Defining what good looks like
  - Promotion criteria: establishing clear criteria for promotions, distingushing between technical and managerial tracks.
- The messy middle
  - Role overlaps: ambiguity existed in the roles of tech lead, engineering manager, and senior engineer.
  - Hands-on leadership: determining the appropriate level of hands-on involement for engineering managers and technical leads.
  - Career progression: providing a clear path for senior engineers who may or may not want to transition into management roles
- Organization gaps
  - New challenges
  - Team strategy
  - Multi-team roles

Changes

- Defining tracks with consistent dimensions and expectations.

- Eliminating ambiguity: differentiating between senior+ engineer and engineering manager.
  - Principal: directing, 12+months horizon, very high ambiguity, 50% glue work, 25% hands-on, impact business
  - Staff: leading, 6-12+months horizon, very high ambiguity, 50% glue work, 50% hands-on, impact multiple teams
  - Senior: engineering, 3+months horizon, high ambiguity, 25% glue work, 75% hands-on, impact team

- Basic: send the credentials in plaintext, for simple applications
- Token: send encrypted token, for single-page app or mobile app
- OAuth: send authorization request and receive grant, for apps needing user data from any external source like Google
- API key: use unique keys, for small projects or for internal use
