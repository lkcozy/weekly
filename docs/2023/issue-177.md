## GeoSpatial

1. [Why the Largest Geospatial Organization in the World Uses the OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2023/02/01/why-the-largest-geospatial-organization-in-the-world-uses-the-openapi-specification)

The largest geospatial organization in the world, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), uses the OpenAPI Specification to define and document its APIs. By using OpenAPI, the OGC can ensure that its APIs are consistent, easy to understand, and can be easily integrated with other geospatial tools and services.

OpenAPI allows the OGC to provide a clear and complete description of its APIs, including details such as input and output parameters, request and response formats, and error handling. This helps to improve the developer experience and reduce the time and effort required to develop and integrate with OGC APIs.

Additionally, using OpenAPI allows the OGC to participate in the larger API ecosystem, which can lead to increased collaboration, innovation, and adoption of OGC standards and services.

2. [Apache Sedona](https://sedona.apache.org/latest-snapshot/)

![](https://sedona.apache.org/latest-snapshot/image/architecture.svg)

Apache Sedona is a cluster computing system for processing large-scale spatial data. It provides a set of powerful tools and functions that can be used to perform various operations on geospatial data, such as filtering, querying, and visualization.

Sedona allows users to work with different types of geospatial data, including points, lines, polygons, and rasters. It supports various file formats, including CSV, GeoJSON, Shapefile, and Parquet. Users can also connect Sedona to different data sources, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache Cassandra, and Apache Geode.

Satellite-track is a program for tracking satellite orbit, developed by cesium, vue and satelliteJS. It supports satellite and satellite constellation orbit display within the next 24 hours (performance considerations); Custom satellite orbit data (TLE) loading is also supported, TLE data is from celestrak;

## AI/ML

1. [Framework for A Foreign Language Teaching Software for Children Utilizing AR, Voicebots and ChatGPT (Large Language Models)](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/2864638)

![](https://unbug.github.io/assets/images/screenshot-20230210-075312.jpg)

The proposed software utilizes emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR), voicebots, and large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT to create an interactive and engaging language learning environment for children, allowing them to practice their language skills through conversations, pronunciation, exercises, and visual aids.

The author suggests that this framework can be used to develop language teaching software for other target languages, making it a versatile and scalable solution for language learning.

3. [Stop Obsessing Over Development Velocity, Focus on This Instead](https://itamargilad.com/velocity-vs-impact/)

Given that companies' management teams will always feel "we can do more with less", the challenge becomes figuring out where is the real bottleneck of scaling the company and aligning on the outcome we seek to gain.

Launching new features or products often fails to create any impact, increases the maintenance cost, and slows the team down. Knowing what will create positive (and significant) outcomes usually takes time. Experimentation with clear targets before we start (define success and failure criteria) can help us figure it out faster.

The viewpoint highlights the importance of focusing on outcomes and experimenting with clear targets to determine the best course of action, rather than just launching new products or features without considering their impact. **It emphasizes the need for a strategic and thoughtful approach to scaling a company.**

## Comments

1. The key lesson here is that if we are to intervene, we need a solid idea of not only the benefits of our interventions but also the harm we may cause—the second and subsequent order consequences. Otherwise, how will we know when, despite our best intentions, we cause more harm than we do good?
   --[Why Intervention Often Leads to Worse Outcomes](https://fs.blog/iatrogenics/)

2. Nothing can make our life, or the lives of other people, more beautiful than perpetual kindness.
   —-Leo Tolstoy

3. The cost of being who you conflict with those who want you to be someone else. The cost of being what others want you to be is in conflict with yourself.
   --[Attention to Detail](https://fs.blog/brain-food/february-19-2023/)

4. A tough reality: Most new managers can't hire someone great to work for them -- at least, not today. Not yet. Not right now. Not on their own. It's a true skill. You gotta help 'em get there, in many cases. Or they will hire a B+.

5. Most people feel there are too many meetings. However, most people also hate the idea that they aren’t being included in important conversations and decisions.

6. It's harder to read code than to write it.
