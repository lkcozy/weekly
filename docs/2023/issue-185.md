## GeoSpatial

1. [Mapping the World’s Highest Mountains, By Continent](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/mapping-highest-mountains-by-continent/)

In this graphic, Arijit Gupta uses data from various sources including Wikipedia, Peakbagger, and EarthENV to highlight three mountains that crown each of the world’s continents.

2. [Using Open GIS Data to Help Map Public Urban Green Spaces](https://www.gislounge.com/mapping-public-urban-green-spaces-open-gis-data/)

The research demonstrates the potential of using remote sensing and machine learning techniques to map green spaces in urban areas. The methodology involves using convolutional neural networks to classify green spaces and Bayesian logistic regression to determine public access. The methodology was found to be fairly accurate, but uncertainty remains in some areas due to unclear results from OSM data.

## AI/ML

1. [Autodoc](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/context-labs/autodoc/master/assets/index-estimate.png)

Autodoc is a experimental toolkit for auto-generating codebase documentation for git repositories using Large Language Models, like GPT-4 or Alpaca. Autodoc can be installed in your repo in about 5 minutes. It indexes your codebase through a depth-first traversal of all repository contents and calls an LLM to write documentation for each file and folder. These documents can be combined to describe the different components of your system and how they work together.

2. [MiniGPT-4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4)

![](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4/raw/main/figs/online_demo.png)

Researchers at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology have developed a vision-language understanding model called MiniGPT-4 that can be used for enhancing generation ability and improving image processing, and which provides emerging vision-language capabilities akin to those demonstrated in GPT-4.

3. [Animated Drawings](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AnimatedDrawings)

This repo contains an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper, `A Method for Animating Children's Drawings of the Human Figure'.

## Tool

1. [Fkill](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fkill-cli)

```zsh
fkill -f -s :8080
```

A fabulously cross-platform tool to kill processes.

2. [Easydict](https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict/blob/main/docs/README_EN.md)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tisfeng/ImageBed/main/uPic/iShot_2023-01-28_17.40.28-1674901716.png)

Easydict is a concise and easy-to-use translation dictionary macOS App that allows you to easily and elegantly look up words or translate text.

3. [Mercury](https://github.com/mljar/mercury)

Mercury allows you to add interactive widgets in Python notebooks, so you can share notebooks as web applications.

## Resources

1. [Getting Started with Docker](https://github.com/collabnix/dockerlabs)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collabnix/dockerlabs/master/images/dockerlabs.jpeg)

DockerLabs provides over 500 interactive tutorials and guides for developers of all levels, covering topics such as Docker security, networking, and AI/ML, as well as language-specific tutorials for developers using Python, Java, Rust, and more.

## Comments

1.  Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.
    --[Steve Jobs](https://fs.blog/brain-food/april-23-2023/)

2.  One way to become luckier is to show up consistently.

When people trust that you’ll do what you say when you say it, not only will they want to work with you, but they’ll want you to be successful. You can’t build anything meaningful when you show up inconsistently.

In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term, you are only as good as your consistency.
--[Brain Food](https://fs.blog/brain-food/april-23-2023/)

3. Practice any art, music, singing, dancing, acting, drawing, painting, sculpting, poetry, fiction, essays, reportage, no matter how well or badly, not to get money and fame, but to experience becoming, to find out what’s inside you, to make your soul grow.
   --[Kurt Vonnegut](https://fs.blog/brain-food/april-23-2023/)
