## Comments

1. Don't promote your programmers into managers. More precisely, don't force that promotion on them directly or indirectly. Instead, appreciate them for what they are, and it will benefit everyone.
   --[Stop promoting programmers](https://blog.steatoda.com/stop-promoting-programmers)

2. You know what motivates most of them and costs nothing? Respect. Respect your programmers at least as much as you respect your line managers.
   --[Stop promoting programmers](https://blog.steatoda.com/stop-promoting-programmers)

3. Management is important for every company (especially on the highest levels), but every software company will benefit more from experienced programmer than from mediocre manager. To give you a parallel: if you ever need a surgery, would you pick the hospital to go to based on managers that run those hospitals or surgeons they employ?
   --[Stop promoting programmers](https://blog.steatoda.com/stop-promoting-programmers)

4. Software companies need managers, there's no doubt about that, but at the same time they need experienced programmers even more, and each time an experienced programmer goes into management, most of their present expertise is lost, often forever.
   --[Stop promoting programmers](https://blog.steatoda.com/stop-promoting-programmers)

5. Being able to create your personal utopia out of indifferent reality is the best measure of intelligence. Success is just being able to have life the way you want it. Being "smart" is just the ability to get what you want.
