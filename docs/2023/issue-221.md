The Southern Ocean, recognized as a separate entity in 2000, is the fourth largest ocean and encircles the continent of Antarctica. It is the coldest ocean and plays a crucial role in global climate regulation and carbon absorption.

The Southern Ocean is instrumental in distributing heat around the planet. The movement of warm water from the equator towards the poles and the reverse flow of cold, dense water influences climate patterns worldwide. This oceanic circulation is a critical component of the Earth’s climate system, affecting weather patterns far beyond the Antarctic region.

1. [A Comprehensive Guide to Methodology in Research](https://typeset.io/resources/methodology-in-research/)

Research methodology refers to the system of procedures, techniques, and tools used to carry out a research study. **It provides a clear roadmap for researchers to follow, ensuring that the research objectives are met effectively.** It encompasses the overall approach, including the research design, data collection methods, data analysis techniques, and the interpretation of findings.

It provides researchers with a structured framework to ensure their investigations are conducted in a systematic and organized manner. By following a well-defined methodology, researchers can ensure that their findings are reliable, valid and meaningful.

- identifying the research problem
- reviewing previous research
- formulating research questions
- implementing the research methodology

1. [50 Ideas That Changed My Life](https://perell.com/essay/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life/)

- Inversion: Avoiding stupidity is easier than trying to be brilliant.
- Robustness Principle: Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. It’s a design guideline for software and a good rule for life: Hold yourself to a higher standard than you hold others to.
- Preference Falsification: People lie about their true opinions and conform to socially acceptable preferences instead. In private they’ll say one thing. In public, they’ll say another.
- Mimetic Theory of Desire: Humans are like sheep. We don’t know what we want, so we imitate each other. Instead of creating our own desires, we desire the same things as other people. The entire advertising industry is built on this idea.
- Competition is for Losers: Avoid competition. Stop copying what everybody else is doing.
- Table Selection: This idea comes from poker, where you’re advised to choose your opponents carefully. That means you shouldn’t compete against the best people. You don’t need to get good at doing difficult things if you get good at avoiding difficult things. If you want to win, pick an easy table and nail your execution.
- Gall’s Law: A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

## Comments

1. I still make things that are pretty awful. It’s part of the process. You have periods of tremendous productivity and other periods where you’re fallow. The fallow periods are really important because that’s where you’re figuring something out. You have to work through it in order to discover something new. You need those sorts of periods in order to grow. --[Paula Scher, The Beautiful Thinkers Project](https://fs.blog/brain-food/december-24-2023/)

2. Awareness, not age, leads to wisdom --[Publius Syrus](https://fs.blog/brain-food/december-24-2023/)

3. If you’re stuck, change your perspective.What you see from 20,000 feet is very different from what you see from 2 feet.Different perspectives reveal different solutions.
   --[Brain Food](https://fs.blog/brain-food/december-24-2023/)

4. Oddly, things get better when you accept the worst-case outcome and focus on improving it. Worrying about what might happen comes at the expense of improving the outcome.
