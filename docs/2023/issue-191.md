Canada's boreal zone is a vast vegetative belt and is a crucial regulator of the global climate and carbon sink, but climate change is causing more frequent and severe wildfires that are releasing more of the carbon stock stored in soils, while also changing the composition of vegetation; both British Columbia and Alberta have already experienced higher-than-normal levels of wildfires in the beginning of the 2023 season due to hot and dry conditions.

2. [Types of Map Projections](https://www.geographyrealm.com/types-map-projections/)

The article discusses the various ways in which we visualize the world, including maps, globes, and satellite imagery. It examines the advantages and limitations of using globes versus maps, the different types of map projections and the distortions they introduce, and the categorizations of these projections into cylindrical, conic, azimuthal, and pseudocylindrical. The article also provides examples of specific map projections within each category.

1. [11 Reasons Why Research Papers Are Rejected](https://typeset.io/resources/11-reasons-why-research-papers-are-rejected/)

![](https://typeset.io/resources/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/editorial-reasons.jpg)

This article lists common reasons for rejection, divided into editorial and technical categories, and offers solutions to avoid rejection and improve the odds of getting published.

- Manuscripts may be rejected if they do not fall within the journal's aim and scope, are under review with another journal, have incomprehensible writing, or do not follow the journal's specific writing guidelines.

- Technical reasons for rejection include a lack of supporting evidence, unclear hypothesis, poor analysis, wrong research methodology, inconclusive result, and violation of research ethics.
- Researchers can use tools like SciSpace Copilot, an AI research assistant, to guide them through creating research hypotheses and improve their writing, formatting, and adherence to journal standards.

2. [Research Methodology: Everything You need to Know](https://typeset.io/resources/your-step-by-step-guide-to-writing-good-research-methodology/)

- A research methodology is a defined process for conducting research.
- A good research methodology includes a clear research procedure, rationality behind the chosen approach, explanation of the mechanism, significance of outcomes, advice for the readers, explanation of the sample space, and consideration of challenges and limitations.
- Instruments for research methodology include interviews, surveys, sample groups, and observations.
- Types of research methodology are qualitative, quantitative, and amalgam.
