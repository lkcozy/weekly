2. As a PhD, I now believe that pursuing a career in science is an enormously selfish and entitled life choice for anyone who doesn't have a trust fund.

It's not just neglect during the PhD. Even a non-neglectful academic is asking a lot of their partner. Stipends are low. Post-docs require chasing term-limited positions around the country, often with little to no savings, for up the half a decade. Building wealth is impossible, having a family is just barely possible, and the process takes you well into mid-life depriving your partner of a career and a real relationship.

I have seen more divorces during post-docs than during PhDs.

Everyone I know who made it through PhDs and post-docs without scars fell into one of two categories: unmarried or wealthy. I think academia's biggest open secret is that a HUGE number of academics -- especially in and around large metros or in nice climates -- are chasing a prestigious and comfortable job because their trust funds allow them to not care about the money and their upbringing makes it difficult for them to deal with having a manager.

To make high-quality decisions, it is important to let go of the illusion of control, communicate the process behind decisions, establish clear principles, and be open to learning and changing perspectives.

- Let go of the idea that you have control over your organization
- Share your mental modals for decision making often and liberally
- Think about and deploy decision-making principles that act as helpful, enabling constraints for everyone
- Literally go around and ask people: "What information would you need to make more, better decisions by yourself, more often?"

## Comments

1. In software, we often see how complexity shifts when a team moves from a monolith to microservices, thinking it will only get better to realize that many things become x10 harder. For humans, it might be x100 more impactful.
   --[Oren Ellenbogen](https://softwareleadweekly.com/issues/559)

2. Better wrong then none.You can learn from wrong choices, you can't learn from inaction. Relish every chance to make decisions. If nothing else, use them as an experiment. At first it sucks, but soon you'll become better.

3. Performance is something that we will give more time; behavior we won’t. And that’s because behavior is a choice, not a skill set.
   --[Frank Slootman](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast-transcripts/frank-slootman-173/)

4. You’re probably really good at something, but most of us spend too much time focusing on our weaknesses and failures. Just focus on your strengths and use that to your advantage.
