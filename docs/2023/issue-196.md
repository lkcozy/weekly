Rapid is a free open-source web-based editor for an OpenStreetMap. In the past the focus was on conflating AI-generated datasets with OpenStreetMap data but the future for this editor is conflating authoritative datasets with OpenStreetMap. Humans are in the loop, people reviewing data authoritative datasets and adding them to OpenStreetMap with a few clicks!

When we develop microservices, we need to follow the following best practices:

- Use separate data storage for each microservice
- Keep code at a similar level of maturity
- Separate build for each microservice
- Assign each microservice with a single responsibility
- Deploy into containers
- Design stateless services
- Adopt domain-driven design
- Design micro frontend
- Orchestrating microservices

## Comments

1. I think that there are two ways of looking at things that have happened to you. You can be a victim or you can be a survivor. Those are two very different cognitive positions. You can‚Äôt control what happens to you in either circumstance, but one is very powerful. You have overcome. One is you have had something happen to you and you are under that thing for quite some period of time.
   --[Julie Gurner](https://fs.blog/brain-food/july-2-2023/)

2. Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let ◊¥work◊¥ mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it. Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.
   --[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)

3. Ideas compound. Inventions compound. Education compounds. A trivial thing can grow into a massive thing, and faster than most people realize. But when you view it as one person coming up with a small idea, another person copying that idea and tweaking it a little, another taking that insight and manipulating it a bit, another yet taking that product and combining it with something else ‚Äì incremental, tiny bits, little ideas mixing, joining, blending, mutating, and compounding together ‚Äì it‚Äôs suddenly much more conceivable.
   --[Compounding Optimism](https://collabfund.com/blog/compounding-optimism/)

4. Active patience implies taking significant steps today to set yourself up for future success. It‚Äôs about strategically preparing for what lies ahead‚Äîsaving more than you spend and investing wisely, developing the necessary skills for future job prospects, choosing kindness over cleverness, and so on.Active patience puts the world on your side. If you go positive and go first, and you do so consistently, the world does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.
