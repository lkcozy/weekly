This article explains what an abstract is, its purpose, the different types and characteristics of a good abstract, and provides examples and tips for writing an effective abstract for research papers.

- The purpose of an abstract is to give readers a quick overview of the research paper and help them decide if they want to read the full paper.
- There are different types of abstracts, including descriptive, informative, and structured abstracts.
- A good abstract should be concise, clear, informative, and highlight the key findings of the research.
- The different sections of an ideal abstract include an introduction or background, research methodology, objectives and goals, results, limitations, and conclusion.

2. [How To Write A Research Summary](https://typeset.io/resources/how-to-write-research-summary-everything-you-need-to-know/)

- A research summary is a brief, informative snapshot of a complex research paper that comes at the end of the paper and summarizes the topic, methods, and findings.
- An abstract is a description of the topic and context at the beginning of the paper, and the two should not be confused.
- To write a research summary, it is important to thoroughly read and understand the parent paper, identify key elements in each section, write in your own words without plagiarism, double check for word count and grammar, and ask someone to proofread the summary for clarity and comprehension.

1. [Manage Process Before People](https://world.hey.com/dhh/manage-process-before-people-20736695)

This article discusses how to run a company with fewer full-time managers by focusing on managing processes instead of people.

- Replace the commonly used daily stand-up meetings with a set of automated questions in Basecamp. Keep everyone in the loop on what someone is working on.
  - What are you going to work on this week?
  - What did you work on today?
- Confine the vast majority of product management planning decisions to happen only once every other month.
  - what should we work on next
- Use [Hill Charts in Basemap](https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts) to give a bird's eye view of "where are we with this project" to anyone who cares to know.
  - replace the vast majority of "will this be shipping soon"
- Rely on the bounded autonomy of the 6-week cycle to cap the risk that projects drag on forever.
  - Hammer the scope and make the necessary trade-offs
- Delegate the review of the work of new employees to mentoring peers.

> If you want to run a company that's light on full-time managers, you have to focus on managing processes before people. The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that's constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.

2. [Common causes of bad decisions](https://fs.blog/brain-food/june-4-2023/)

- Assumptions based on small sample sizes
- Wanting the world to work the way we want rather than the way it does
- Conforming to expectations/authority/group (social default)
- Blindness to large trends (blind spots)
- Not asking, “and then what?”

4. Two things control our sleep. [One is our] homeostatic need, which is the longer you’re awake, the more you need sleep. And the other is the circadian clock timing of it. So one thing that helps you to have a good, solid, even circadian clock is in the morning when you wake up, expose yourself to bright light.
