This article provides a list of shapefile viewers for viewing GIS vector data in shapefile format, explaining what a shapefile is and how to view it using various software programs or online options.

- A shapefile is a common format for storing GIS data, developed by Esri, that stores non-topological vector data along with related attribute data in point, line, and polygon forms.
- Desktop shapefile viewers include ArcGIS Explorer, TNTatlas, and TatukGIS Viewer, while online options include LSI Viewer and Equator Studios' shapefile viewer.

Graduated symbols in GIS are a way to visualize quantitative data on a map by using symbols of varying sizes to represent values or magnitudes. This allows for easy comparison of data across different geographic locations. Graduated symbols are classified into ranges and can be used to compare populations, water usage, and other quantitative attributes.

3. [Comparing Median Employment Income in Large Canadian and American Metropolitan Areas](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/comparing-median-employment-income-in-large-canadian-and-american-metropolitan-areas.pdf)

Canada’s largest cities, including Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, which collectively represent a significant portion of the country’s population, sit at the lower end of the rankings. This suggests that even within Canada, the largest cities do not perform particularly well in median employment income. Most of the top performing metro areas are large US population centers.

1. [The Metrics of Fear](https://hagakure.substack.com/p/twh49-the-metrics-of-fear#%C2%A7fear)

- Founders live in fear that their baby won’t make it.
- CEOs live in fear of their board, and that the forecast won’t be met.
- Senior management lives in fear of their CEO and of their performance targets.
- Middle managers live in fear of their bosses, and of their teams’ expectations.
- Individual contributors live in fear of the next performance review, and not meeting the sprint goals.

When we’re in fear, distressed and anxious, the amygdala takes over and the thinking brain goes offline. We stop responding and start reacting. Whatever our defaults, that’s what we will automatically resort to.

> “We don’t rise to the level of our expectations. We fall to the level of our training.” ―Archilochus

And what is that training (read: default) for most senior leaders in in most places? **Control. Tighten the ship.**

## Comments

1. Life's better when you constantly assume you could be wrong. You learn more. Resent less. And attract smart people. Being wrong says nothing about you as a person. Not being able to admit it does.

2. With the Outlier Algorithm, my logic was inverted: If others liked this, it may be worth becoming familiar with, but I can’t use it to make a big profit or impact.
