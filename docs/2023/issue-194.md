2. [Sane defaults for Github repositories](https://wiringbits.net/blog/github-repository-setup)

![](https://wiringbits.net/assets/posts/github-repository-setup/branch-list.png)

We’ll tweak the repository General and Branches settings so that:

- Enable Automatically delete head branches.
- Enable Always suggest updating pull request branches.
- Disable Allow merge commits (read below before arguing).
- Update Allow squash and merging -> Default commit message.

Then, create a branch protection rule for important branches:

- Enable Require a pull request before merging -> Require approvals.
- Enable Require status checks to pass before merging -> Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Enable Require linear history.

## Comments

1. The saddest form of success is realizing that the goals you achieved weren't yours at all. In the short run, pursuing other people's dreams earns approval. In the long run, it's a recipe for regret. A meaningful purpose doesn't maximize your status. It matches your values.

2. It kills me that people keep talking about programming as though that was a significant part of a practicing engineer’s job. Code is an artifact, not the goal. Programming is an implementation detail, not the job.
