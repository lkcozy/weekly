Hundreds of rivers flow over the Earth's surface, carrying fresh water from hills and mountains to bigger rivers, lakes, and seas.

A river basin, drainage basin, or watershed is where all flowing surface water congregates.

Adam Symington created these maps of the world's rivers and main river basins, which are divided down by continent and based on the HydroSHEDS database.

A buffer in GIS is a reclassification based on distance: classification of within/without given proximity.

Buffering involves measuring the distance outward in all directions from an object. Buffering can be done on all three types of vector data: point, line, and area. The resulting buffer is a polygon file.

4. [Momentum Creates Motivation](https://fs.blog/brain-food/january-8-2023/)

If you wait until you're motivated, you've already lost.

Surgeons don't always feel like doing surgery. Teachers don't always feel like teaching. Parents don't always feel like cooking. Firemen don't always feel like rushing into a burning building.

If you let motivation dictate your actions, inertia conspires to keep you in place.

Action creates progress. Progress creates momentum. Momentum creates motivation.
