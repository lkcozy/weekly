## GeoSpatial

1. [Mapping Long-term Land Use Change with Remote Sensing Data](https://www.gislounge.com/mapping-land-use-change-remote-sensing/)

Land use change has been one of the most sustained and obvious results of the Anthropocene, where deforestation, agriculture, and expanding cities have left a clear imprint on our planet.

Monitoring this change is key to understanding its impacts but also to potentially alert scientists and policy makers where change needs to happen to stop destruction of our natural environment.

2. [Green View Index for QGIS](https://www.gislounge.com/green-view-index-qgis/)

Green View Index is a QGIS plugin that can be used to easily calculate Green View Index through Google Street View images. Unlike satellite derived NDVI, which provides a mapping of vegetation from the top level, GVI utilizes street-level imagery to quantify the presence of vegetation from a human-eye point of view.

## Research

1. [How to Write an Effective Background of the Study: A Comprehensive Guide](https://typeset.io/resources/what-is-the-background-of-the-study/)

The background of the study is placed at the beginning of a research paper. It offers a clear context, highlighting why the research is essential and the problem it aims to address.

When crafting the background of your study, consider the following questions.

- What's the context of your research?
- Which previous research will you refer to?
- Are there any knowledge gaps in the existing relevant literature?
- How will you justify the need for your current research?
- Have you concisely presented the research question or problem?

> Background: provides context and logical reasons for the research, explaining why the study is necessary. Focus on the historical context, previous studies, and the evolution of the research topic.
> Introduction: entails the broader scope of the research, hinting at its objectives and significance. Focus on the broader research field, potential implications, and a preview of the research structure.

1. [Building an onboarding plan for engineering managers Process](https://leaddev.com/process/building-onboarding-plan-engineering-managers)

An effective onboarding plan prepares new hires for their role, connects them to the organization’s culture and values, and clarifies what is expected from them.

An effective onboarding plan for engineering managers should focus on providing a sense of belonging and a sense of accomplishment. The plan should include clear goals, ownership, theoretical sessions(discussions and presentations about the different parts of the manager’s role), hands-on experiences, and customization for each manager's background.

- Interpersonal skills: member's well-being, professional growth, performance
  - performance review process
  - career levels nad growth path
  - give feedback
- Delivery management: execution and process. project management, velocity and impact
  - team rituals: daily stand-up
  - the OKR process
  - development cycle and release flow
- Technical leadership: code standard and quality, review architectural decisions
  - architecture and design principles
  - observability: monitoring, logging, and alerting
  - incident management process

> Belonging: The feeling that you’re a part of something – the team, the engineering organization, and the company.
> Accomplishment: Gives the new hire confidence and a feeling that they’ve contributed something meaningful to the group.

## Comments

1. Why we should strive for greatness even if, or because of, life is "meaningless" (we'll all be forgotten). We strive for greatness because it makes life interesting. We leverage our skills because it's fun to feel valuable. We act even if we might fail because growth requires stories. Just show up and do your thing. Nobody cares about you. They all have their stories. --[Oren Ellenbogen](https://softwareleadweekly.com/issues/566)

2. Effective management is about adapting to the needs and preferences of your team. The true essence of effective leadership lies in adaptation. Each team member is unique, and successful management means experimenting with various approaches tailored to their individual needs.
