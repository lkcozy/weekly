1. [Human mobility and COVID-19 transmission: a systematic review and future directions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19475683.2022.2041725)

The article reviews the studies that have used human mobility data to analyze COVID-19 transmission and provides a systematic framework for future research. They propose a conceptual model that links human mobility data, COVID-19 transmission dynamics, and intervention measures. They suggest some challenges and opportunities for future research on human mobility and COVID-19 transmission.

The article discusses the new and improved Earth at Night map released by NASA. The map, which uses satellite data, shows the extent and intensity of human activity at night. The article explains how the map was created and its potential uses, such as identifying areas that need more attention in terms of light pollution and energy consumption. It also highlights some of the limitations of the map and its implications for environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.

3. [Good thinking](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-5-2023/)

Good thinking is expensive. Bad thinking costs a fortune.

One way to force yourself to think is to write. Good writing requires good thinking.

Forcing yourself to make your thinking visible gives poor thinking nowhere to hide. You can’t simply take a few minutes here and there, get the gist of the problem, and expect to have clear writing. It doesn’t work that way.

Good writing, like good thinking, takes time.

## Comments

1.  Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. Importantly, writing is also the process by which you figure it out.
    --[In a world of AI writing on demand, a case for the need to write](https://fs.blog/why-write/)

2.  Doing your best isn't about the result. It's about the preparation. It's about the position you find yourself in before you do whatever you are doing. When you put yourself in the proper position, the result takes care of itself. The average person who puts themselves in a great position beats the genius who finds themselves in a poor position.
