2. [What is a thesis | A Complete Guide with Examples](https://typeset.io/resources/what-is-a-thesis-a-complete-guide/)

A guide offers revelations and methodologies to transform this seemingly overwhelming thesis into a manageable and rewarding academic milestone.

A thesis is a comprehensive academic paper that identifies a specific topic of inquiry and presents a clear argument or perspective about that topic using evidence and logic. Writing a thesis showcases your ability of critical thinking, gathering evidence, and making compelling arguments. However, writing a thesis can be laborious, especially for beginners. From the initial challenge of pinepointing a compelling research topic to organizing and presentign findings, the process is filled with potential pitfalls.

The key of writing the thesis lies in writing a compelling thesis statement.

- thesis statement: a concise summary of the main argument or claim of the paper.
  - ðŸ’¡clear, concise, and debatable
  - a roadmap of your thesis, directing readers through your arguments and findings.
  - offers readers an immediate understanding of the context and the gravity of your study.
  - ensure clarity and precision
- abstract: summarize the critical aspects of your research in 300 words
  - problem statement
  - methodology
  - key finds
  - conclusions
- acknowledge: express gratitude to those who've supported yoru journey
- table of contents: list the chapters, sections, and subsections of your thesis
- list of figures and tables
- introudction: introduce research topic, articulate the research question or objective, and outline the significance of your study
  - ðŸ’¡provide sufficient background and context
  - present the research the topic
  - background information
  - define the scope
  - review existing research
  - state the research questions or objectives
  - outline the study's structure
- literature review: engage in a dialogue with existing research, highlighting relevant studies, theories, and findings
  - ðŸ’¡comprehensive, relevant, and well-organized
  - identify gaps in the current knowledge
  - positioning your research as a bridge to new insights
  - leverage SciSpace literature review tool
- methodology: detail the tools, techniques, and processes you employed to gather and analyze data.
  - ðŸ’¡describe and justify the research methods
  - inform the readers about how you approached your research questions and ensures the reproducibility of your study
  - research design
  - data collection
  - sampling
  - data analysis
  - validity and reliability
  - ethical considerations
- results or findings: the outcomes of your research
  - ðŸ’¡clearly and logically
  - quantitative results: measurable outcomes
  - qualitative results: patterns, themes, or narratives derived from non-numerical data
- discussion: transform the raw data into valuable insights
  - ðŸ’¡interpret the results in light of the research question and existing literature
- practical implications: provide actionable suggestions or proposed solutions
- conclusion: reflect on the broader contributions of your study
  - ðŸ’¡summarize the research and suggesting future directions or implications

1. [Refactoring is a daily job](https://www.briansnotes.io/article/refactoring-is-a-daily-job/)

Refactoring offers a massive opportunity to increase your deployment frequency. Done consistently, incremental and well-tested refactorings will become a major component of your release culture.

- Refactoring is a daily job.
- You will not get permission from the business to refactor code.
- Successful refactoring requires a specific purpose.
- When you review a PR with a patchwork fix, directly ask the engineer to refactor the code instead.
- Celebrate when engineers refactor code.

2. [How we built a GPT code agent that generates full-stack web apps in React & Node.js, explained simply](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/07/17/how-we-built-gpt-web-app-generator)

The GPT Web App Generator allows users to describe the web app they want to create, and in minutes, a full-stack codebase in React, Node.js, Prisma, and Wasp is generated for download and local use.
