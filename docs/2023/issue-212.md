Ships release pollution particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei, resulting in the formation of ship tracks. Ship tracks can be seen from satellite imagery and are brighter than other clouds due to smaller and more frequent cloud particles. The size and appearance of ship tracks depend on the speed and direction of the ship. Ship tracks have a cooling effect, blocking solar energy from reaching the ocean surface.

1. [15 principles for managing up](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/15-principles-for-managing-up)

Managing up is a crucial skill for career growth and success, involving effective communication, proactive problem-solving, and demonstrating competence and reliability to your manager.

- Embrace managing up. ✅ My manager is busy with their job, plus a bunch of worries I don’t know about. They might feel awkward asking me to manage up more, so I'll take the reins and manage up proactively.
- Give enough context to avoid back-and-forth follow ups.
- Show your thought process. ✅ “I recommend X. Here's rationale, data points, or examples of why this should work. The risk is Y but we can address by Z. If you agree, I’ll start by doing [first step].
- Flag potential issues.
- Bring solutions, not complaints. ✅ “This process isn’t working because X. I’d like to update to Y process instead, which should be cheaper/faster/easier. Let me know what I might be missing or if you agree to proceed.
- Action items or question at the top, context separately below.
- Proactively assert what to do.
- Don’t only ask questions. Share your point of view too.
- Anticipate questions.
- Be explicit about what you need. Hey, can you take a look? I’m looking for directional feedback on whether it makes sense to go down this path, no need for line edits yet.

## Comments

1. It’s so simple: you spend less than you earn. Invest shrewdly. Avoid toxic people and toxic activities. Try to keep learning all your life. And do a lot of deferred gratification. If you do all those things, you are almost certain to succeed. And if you don’t, you’ll need a lot of luck. And you don’t want to need a lot of luck. You want to go into a game where you’re very likely to win without having any unusual luck.

2. Being single is better than being in a toxic relationship. Being in a great relationship is better than being single. The right partner puts everything else in easy mode.

3. If you want to understand someone doing something that doesn’t make sense to you, ask yourself what the world would have to look like for those actions to make sense. Change your perspective to change what you see.
