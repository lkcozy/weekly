The article addresses common questions and misconceptions about global warming and its causes.It explains that humans are the main culprits of CO2 emissions, which contribute to global warming. The article also discusses the correlation between CO2 levels and temperatures, and how CO2 warms up the planet through the greenhouse effect.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are greenhouse gases because they stop or reflect infrared light but let visible light through, which means solar light reaches the Earth and warms it up, but the rays emitted by the warm Earth are caught or reflected by the atmosphere and don’t leave.

Other gases might have opposite effects, such as reflecting visible light but letting infrareds through. For example, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a known reflector of sunlight. Just a tiny amount can cool the Earth. This is how volcanoes do it.

## Comments

1. I sought good judgment mostly by collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such outcomes.
   --[The Psychology of Human Misjudgment](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/)

2. I think a life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn all the time. -— Charlie Munger

3. You should never, when faced with one unbelievable tragedy, let one tragedy increase into two or three because of a failure of will. -— Charlie Munger

4. Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless, you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.
   -— Charlie Munger

5. It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent. -— Charlie Munger

6. I am not smart enough to make decisions with no time to think. I make actual decisions very rapidly, but that’s because I have spent so much time preparing ourselves by quietly reading. -— Charlie Munger

7. Only the best can really take constructive feedback. Everyone else just wants to be told they are doing well
