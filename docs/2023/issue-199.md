## Comments

1. Problem solving has to do with curiosity. It has to do with people wondering, ‘What makes something do something?’ And then to discover, when you try to get answers, that they’re related to each other.
   --[Richard Feynman](https://fs.blog/brain-food/july-30-2023/)

2. Eating well, saving money, sleeping, preparing for your next job, taking on more responsibility at work, removing people from your life who drag you down, reading and learning, etc. When you master your circumstances, every path is a winner. When your circumstances master you, things quickly go from bad to worse.
   --[Brain Food](https://fs.blog/brain-food/july-30-2023/)

3. Patience only works if you do. Doing the work + patience = results. Planning to work + patience = you’re just waiting.
