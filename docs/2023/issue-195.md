LocationSimulator is a macOS app (10.15.x and later) which allows spoofing the location of an iOS or iPhoneSimulator device. The target audience of this project are developers who want to test their location service based application. I do not encourage the use of this application to cheat in iOS games and I do not provide support for these games. If you use this application outside of the intended purposes, you are on your own.

iCalendar is a widely used data format that is used to represent calendars and schedules. It provides a way to define recurring events using a syntax called RRULE. The rrule.js library is a powerful tool that allows developers to work with these rules and manipulate them programmatically.
