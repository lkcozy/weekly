3. [People do 3 types of work within companies](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1329330848919810049)

- Produce: Creating artifacts to serve the company’s external stakeholders.
  - products, eng infra, sales deals, services, support, status updates,...
- Organize:Creating the necessary structures & processes for Produce work.
  - internal processes, resource planning, status updates, re-orgs, hiring,...
- Self-promote: Creating a proxy for their own competence & impact.
  - perf reviews, status updates, 1:1s with manager,...

The 3 key sources of conflict within a company:

- Self-promote work disguised as Produce work or Organize work (Politics)
- Disagreement on relative priorities of Produce work (Strategy problem)
- Too much Organize work too little Produce work or vice versa (Execution problem)

Role of company leadership: A company’s leaders need to be able to precisely & consistently diagnose the source of major conflicts. They need to be particularly intolerant of Self-promote work that's suboptimal for the company, even if it's optimal for a given individual or team

Role of managers: Managers need to create clarity for each employee on the optimal allocation of time across the 3 types of work, for their specific role on the team.When managers fail to do this, each employee picks their own subjective defaults, causing mutual frustration.

## Comments

1. Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you're talking about. Of course, you can learn a lot about something without writing about it. However, writing about something complicated and hard to pin down acts as a test to see how well you understand it. When we approach our work as a stranger, we often discover how something that seems so simple in our heads is explained entirely wrong.

2. Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.

3. What’s ONE thing you can do today that makes tomorrow easier? Repeat.

4. In most companies people are doing two jobs: their actual job and the job of managing others’ impressions of how they’re doing their job.

5. Make sure all decisions are documented. Provide weekly updates to the rest of the organization about progress. What has been worked on, what is being worked on, and what happens next. Create a public roadmap that holds the whole team accountable.

6. When picking a profession, the beauty is understanding it is a craft that will take a lifetime to master.

7. It’s easy to envy people with incredible wisdom until you remember the incredible pain they endured to acquire it. The fruits of wisdom taste sweet, but they’re earned by walking through the thorn bush.
