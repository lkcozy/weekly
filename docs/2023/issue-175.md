## Comments

1. Back to back meetings create an illusion of productivity. The reason I’m concerned about the current meeting overload culture, is the trade-off being proactive and reactive work.

2. The difference between open and closed-minded people: Over time, the person who approaches life with an openness to being wrong and a willingness to learn outperforms the person who doesn’t.

3. One sign that determination matters more than talent: there are lots of talented people who never achieve anything, but not that many determined people who don’t.
   --[Paul Graham]()

4. Teams can also control tech debt by creating less of it. This is an iterative process: when asked to add a new feature, a team considers how well the current design can accommodate that feature. If the design is already suitable, they add the feature. But if the design is unsuitable, they update the design first, then add the feature.

5. Just ask developers how many hours per month get wasted due to tech debt, and then take the average. Show that number to executives to make a case for investing in cleanup.
