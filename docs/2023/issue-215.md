The author has developed a game concept called "Around The World" where players step into the shoes of ancient naval explorers and navigate the world without modern technology.

The author explains the challenges of creating a game that takes place on a sphere rather than a flat map, and the solution they came up with using a quadrilateralized spherical cube.

They also discuss the process of creating realistic continent shapes using Voronoi diagrams and simplex noise.

Lastly, the author discusses adding height variation to the land and simulating erosion to make the world look more realistic.

3. [Strategy, not self-expression: How to decide what to say when giving feedback](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/strategy-not-self-expression)

Self-expression is why most feedback conversations fail

Strategy means only saying things that get you closer to changing the person’s behavior. You should only say things that you strongly believe will incentivize the other person to change in the right direction. Strategy is probably 10% of what you initially want to say.

Self-expression is venting, having the last word, or trying to teach someone a lesson. It’a trying to prove you are right or wanting the person to feel remorse. Anything that isn’t 100% going to encourage the person to improve goes in the self-expression bucket.

How to focus on strategy, not self-expression

- mentally forgive the person: get the emotion out of you, be positive or at least neutral
- identify what is most likely to motivate them to change: We feel motivated and committed when we’re excited to do something, not when we’re being punished.
- say only 10% that will actually change behavior: Be specific with what you want the person to do going forward, and pitch why the new behavior is benefits them
- always be framing: Will saying this motivate the person to do what I want them to do? Is this strategy or self-expression?

## Comments

1. I have found it helpful to drive the conversation individually before exposing it to a larger group. That has allowed me to understand many perspectives and adapt the solution to them, ensuring everyone felt heard.

2. The problem is that performance reviews, promotions, bonuses, and other evaluations are based on the work they remember. And if they don't remember, you can be evaluated as if you never dit it. And people suck at remembering.

3. Patience helps you trust the process as a designer. It guides you when you're annoyed of yourself not finding a solution to your problem today, right now. It reminds you that efforts build and compound. Patience is in itself optimistic. It requires believing that whatever you want now will still be there in the future – or may even be better in the future.

4. Instead of being super frustrated by how busy your manager is these days, is there something you could do to help them get more leverage?

5. Chase your own best version, not the shadow of someone else’s success. Self-competition is the key to personal growth.

6. When you’re looking for a job, there is a big difference between coming across as self-confident (improves your chances) and coming across as someone who deserves the job (ruins your chances esp. for coveted jobs). Remember: You need the job. The company doesn’t owe you the job.
