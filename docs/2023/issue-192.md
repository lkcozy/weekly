This paper presents a process that leaders can follow to improve the productivity of their teams. The first part of the paper describes the categories of technical debt. the second part of the paper explores how these categories may be measured. Then, the final part of this paper provides several tactics that may help reduce tech debt.

The researchers identified 10 categories of technical debt, listed in order of the most to least frequently reported as a hindrance to productivity:

- Migration is needed or in progress.
- Documentation on project and APIs.
- Testing.
- Code quality.
- Dead and/or abandoned code.
- Code degradation.
- Team lacks necessary expertise.
- Dependencies.
- Migration was poorly executed or abandoned.
- Release process.

## Comments

1. Authenticity is the key to escaping competition, as nobody can compete with being true to oneself, and combines one's vocation and avocation to create a unique skill stack.
   --[Naval：Escape Competition Through Authenticity](https://nav.al/competition-authenticity)

2. Ultimately, blogs are a person’s place to express themselves. Their planting of a flag in the digital realm. It is their shout into the void, their way of saying “this is me”.
   --[Will AI kill blogging?](https://herman.bearblog.dev/will-ai-kill-blogging/)

3. Productivity hack: Make it as easy as possible to work as hard as you can.
   --[Twitter User](https://twitter.com/AlexHormozi/status/1662995079366344705)

4. Designing a functional, outcome-oriented work culture is really hard and often no one's job.

5. We think the more information we consume the more signal we’ll consume. Only the mind doesn’t work like that. When the volume of information increases, our ability to comprehend the relevant from the irrelevant becomes compromised. We place too much emphasis on irrelevant data and lose sight of what’s really important.
   --[The Noise Bottleneck](https://fs.blog/noise-and-signal-nassim-taleb/)

6. Big ambitions, low expectations, and high standards are a powerful combination for living your best life. Ambitions pull you forward when it’s hard. They connect you to something larger. Reality minus expectations = happiness. You will never be happy unless your expectations are exceeded. High standards – When it gets hard, do not lower your standards.
   --[Brian Food](https://ctt.ec/f7083)

7. Wealthy people have smaller circles of trust than you’d imagine. The more successful you become, the fewer people you can trust. The more successful, the less the public thinks of you; billionaire has become a pejorative word. The more successful you become, the harder it is to find someone who will look you in the face and tell you the truth.
