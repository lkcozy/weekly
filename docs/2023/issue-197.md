felt.com is a browser-based mapping tool and but its also a reminder that just because we have always done web mapping one way it doesn’t mean it always has to be done that way.

For example, Felt lets you upload anything! That’s a bold promise, you can upload anything you want and we will figure it out on the back end.

Felt is also the first and only flagship sustaining member of the QGIS project, they are supporting the development of a build and open-source tiling engine, Tippecanoe.

To help you navigate the vast landscape of architectural styles and patterns, there is a cheat sheet that encapsulates all. This cheat sheet is a handy reference guide that you can use to quickly recall the main characteristics of each architectural style and pattern.

- MVP: Model-View-Controller, separate the concerns of data management, user interface, and control flow.
- Domain-Driven: focuses on the domain logic and complexity rather than the technology used.
- Event-Driven: promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.
- Microservice: a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services
- Layered: separates software into logical layers.

## Comments

1. Building great products is a matter of having taste and knowing when your product will resonate with customers. Unfortunately, this is why there are so few good product managers. I can't teach taste or the kind of extreme ownership over problems that we require, nor can I teach customer empathy. I can help fine-tune these skills, but my job is to select people who already possess these qualities.

2. The biggest alignment problem is the gap between how much people think they have to align versus what they should align on. Without alignment, autonomy is squandered.
   --[Alignment > Autonomy](https://buildrightside.com/autonomy-alignment)

3. Read to fill your mind, write to clear your mind.

4. The difference between failure and success is often just staying with it a little longer. One more rep.One more step.One more minute.One more revision.One more attempt.The difference between average and outstanding is often just one more.
