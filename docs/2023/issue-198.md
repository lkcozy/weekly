El Niño is a natural phenomenon that occurs irregularly every two to seven years, with a rise in sea-surface temperatures across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, weakening of trade winds, and changes in atmospheric circulation. The redistribution of heat during El Niño alters weather patterns globally, causing floods in some regions and droughts in others.

Maps using data from the UN FAO reveal the distribution and density of different types of livestock around the world, showing variations in production and consumption habits.

Livestock, including meat, dairy, and eggs, make up a significant portion of the average person's diet.

- Chicken livestock is widespread globally, with high densities in almost all populated regions.
- Pig livestock is concentrated in specific regions, including China, the Midwest in the US, and Central Europe.
- Cattle distribution is similar to chicken distribution, with high densities in regions such as India, Brazil, and the US.
- Ducks are mainly concentrated in China, but Vietnam and France also have significant duck production.
- Sheep populations are highest in North and Central Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.
- Goats are concentrated in North India, North China, Mongolia, and many African countries.

2. Any decision where the benefit or cost is temporary, you should make without much investment. Any decision which compounds into the foreseeable future, whether benefits or costs or both, you'd better seriously consider. And say "no" if future costs > benefits. The last part is only known in hindsight if at all. Even then we often conflate it with experimentation or just cost of doing business instead of mistake.
