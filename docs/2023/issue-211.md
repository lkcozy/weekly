Maps twist our perception of the world. Countries closer to the equator—which happen to be seem smaller than they are. This is because the world is a 3D sphere, but maps are 2D projections on a plane. That means distortion!

Conversely, if you center the map around Alaska, you can see why it has the 3rd biggest airport in the world in terms of cargo: it’s the most central point to all the big markets in the northern hemisphere.

- social developer: feel productive when helping coworkers, collaborating and doing code reviews.
- lone developer: avoid disruption such as noise, email, meetings and code reviews. They feel most productive when they have little to no social interactions and when they can work on solving problems, fixing bugs or coding features in quiet and without interruptions.
- focused developer: feel most productive when they are working efficiently and concentrated on a single task at a time.
- balanced developer: are less affected by disruptions. They are also less likely to come to work early or stay at work late.
- leading developer: are more comfortable with meetings and emails. They feel more productive in the afternoon and whey they can write and design things.
- goal-oriented developer: feel productive when complete or make progress on tasks. They feel less productive when they multi-task, are goal-less or are stuck.

Insights:

- Teams may benefit from increased awareness about each member's communication preferences.
- Leaders may opt for synchronous communication with social developers, and asynchronous communication with lone developers.
- An exploration task for a new product that is rather open without clear goals, and that requires a lot of discussion, might be less suitable for a goal-oriented, a lone or a balanced developer.

## Comments

1. Your product is an asset, but code is a liability.Your product solves your customer's problem(s), and therefore is your asset. The code itself is the cost of creating the asset. The more code you have, the more it needs to be read, tested, changed, and understood.

2. As developers, our task is not just to solve today's problems but also to ensure we do not become tomorrow's problem.
   --[Good code is like a love letter to the next developer who will maintain it](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-code/)

3. Talent and potential mean nothing if you can’t consistently do the boring things when you don’t feel like doing them.

4. While the rest of us are chasing brilliance, the best in the world know they must avoid stupidity before they can win.

5. Reason is the steering wheel. Emotion is the gas pedal.
