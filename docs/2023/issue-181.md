The paper studied 52 professional software engineers who self-reflected on their work every day for two to three weeks. Purposeful, continuous self-reflection has been found to increase engineer productivity and happiness.

Daily self-reflection not only increased engineers' awareness of work habits, progress, and achievement but also led to productive (short-term) behaviour change.

Frequent self-reflection helps engineers help themselves.

## Comments

1. When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.

2. Do my expectations match the level of effort I’m giving? --[Brain Food](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-26-2023/)

3. The challenge for successful organizations moving forward is not they do not have scale, skill, or speed but rather what happens as a new world emerges where the benefits of scale diminish when new skills become critical but the ability to hire the newly skilled with the old incentives are reduced, and the speed of the world outstrips the speed of the organization.
