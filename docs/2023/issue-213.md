The terminator is the line that divides the Earth between daylight and nighttime, passing through most locations twice a day for sunrise and sunset. It is a result of the Earth's rotation on its axis and its position relative to the Sun. The Earth's tilt at an angle of 23.5 degrees leads to seasons and changes in the terminator line. The equinoxes result in the terminator dividing the Earth into equal halves of day and night, while the solstices result in longer or shorter days depending on the hemisphere.

- Use fake names or generate random names when registering accounts to make it harder for people to look you up.
- Create random usernames and avoid using the same username across multiple platforms to prevent people from finding your profiles on different services.
- Use masked emails or temporary email services to maintain privacy and avoid connecting different usernames across sites.
- Use unique passwords for each site to prevent accounts from being linked to each other if passwords are leaked.
- Avoid using personal photos as profile pictures and opt for generated images or default avatars to prevent reverse image search.
- Use multiple accounts for the same service, and utilize browser features like containers to stay logged in without switching accounts.
- Delete old content and regularly clean up online presence to minimize the amount of personal information available.

2. "You do not have to sit outside in the dark." - This suggests that one doesn't necessarily have to be in a difficult or challenging situation to gain knowledge or understanding.

"If, however, you want to look at the stars, you will find that darkness is necessary." - Here, the idea is that to gain a deeper understanding or to appreciate certain aspects of life (symbolized by the stars), one may need to go through challenging or difficult times (symbolized by darkness).

"But the stars neither require nor demand it." - This part emphasizes that the knowledge or insights gained from difficult experiences are not obligatory; they are not imposed by the external circumstances. The stars (representing knowledge or enlightenment) don't demand the darkness; it's just a condition under which they become visible.

Overall, the quote seems to suggest that while challenges or difficult times may bring opportunities for growth and understanding, they are not mandatory for gaining insight. It's a choice to embrace the darkness to see the stars, metaphorically speaking.

1. [The Best Available Human Standard](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-best-available-human-standard)

The author argues for a pragmatic approach to AI, acknowledging that it has both positive and negative implications and emphasizing the need to harness its potential for good. They highlight three fundamental truths about AI: its ubiquity, its hidden capabilities, and its limitations and risks. The author proposes the Best Available Human (BAH) standard as a pragmatic way to determine when AI can be helpful.

AI can be a helpful tool for potential entrepreneurs in generating ideas and creating prototypes. AI can serve as a coach or facilitator in various domains, such as conducting after-action reviews or providing leadership advice.

- The Best Available Co-Founder
  - Come up with 10 business ideas that would be doable by an MBA student in education. they should involve building a website or app, and it should be possible to come up with a rapid prototype for that website or app.
  - describe the prototype website for idea 1 in detail, making sure it is something you could create for me with the tools and abilities you have.
  - come up with 10 names for the business, then review the names and pick the one that you think is best. Write a one-paragraph pitch for the business that describes what we do and why it is good.
  - I need you to create a prototype for the "xxx" you have to give me a zip file with working html, js, and css as needed. It needs to fully work. Focus on the dashboard if you can't do anything else.

## Comments

1. What we consider defining moments, like promotions or a new house, matter less to life satisfaction than the accumulation of tiny moments that didn’t seem to matter at the time. In the end, everyday moments matter more than big prizes. Tiny delights over big bright lights.

2. The older I get, the more I realize how valuable it is to let go of the anchors holding you back. When someone makes a mistake, forgive them. When someone wrongs you, move on. When someone slights you, let it go. When someone tells you they didn’t mean it, believe them. When someone tries to pull you down, let them go. Moving forward helps a lot and doesn’t cost a thing.

3. Staretegy is about tradeoffs, not about making everyone happy, not about having no consequences.
