Overture is for developers who build map services or use geospatial data.

The ultimate mission of the Overture Maps Foundation is to power new map products through openly available datasets that can be used and reused across applications and businesses, with each member throwing their data and resources into the mix.

Overture, along with other contributors, aim to deliver:

- **Collaborative Map Building**: Overture aims to incorporate data from multiple sources, including Overture Members, civic organizations, and open data sources.
- **Global Entity Reference System**: Overture will simplify interoperability with a system that links entities from different data sets to the same real-world entities.
- **Quality Assurance Processes**: Overture data will undergo validation to detect map errors, breakage, and vandalism to help ensure that map data can be used in production systems.
- **Structured Data Schema**: Overture will define and drive the adoption of a common, structured, and documented data schema to create an easy-to-use ecosystem of map data.

The objective of a graphical traceroute is to discover each server relaying your IP packet from one point to another and to measure the return-trip delay between the probing host (here G Suite. Tools) and each relay on the packet path.

2. [Types of Databases and Use Cases](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep36-types-of-databases-and-use-cases)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31662535-c0e6-43ee-adcb-c0349a431368_3141x2685.jpeg)

Hundreds or even thousands of databases are available today, such as Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, MongoDB, S3, Ceph, etc.

- Relational database. They could solve almost anything.
- In-memory store. Their speed and limited data size make them ideal for fast - operations.
- Time-series database. Store and manage time-stamped data.
- Graph database. It is suitable for complex relationships between unstructured objects.
- Document store. They are good for large immutable data.
- Wide column store. They are usually used for big data, analytics, reporting, etc., which needs denormalized data.

3. [How does REST API work?](https://blog.devgenius.io/best-practice-and-cheat-sheet-for-rest-api-design-6a6e12dfa89f?gi=f8699123d274)

![the complete diagram to easily understand REST API’s principles, methods, and best practices](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*lFGlOSW19H184tUt9DhvUg@2x.webp)

This best-practices article intends for developers interested in creating RESTful Web services that provide high reliability and consistency across multiple service suites; following these guidelines, services are positioned for rapid, widespread, public adoption by internal and external clients.

4. [Good Conversations Have Lots of Doorknobs](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/good-conversations-have-lots-of-doorknobs)

Givers think conversations unfold as a series of invitations; takers think conversations unfold as a series of declarations. So when the giver meets the giver or taker meets the taker, all is well. When the giver meets the taker, however, the giver gives, the taker takes, and the giver gets resentful ("Why won't he ask me a single question?") while the taker has a lovely time ("She must really think I'm interesting!") or gets annoyed ("My job is so boring, why does she keep asking me about it?").

## Comments

1. Companies Are More Successful When They Define How They Work. Instead of Trying to Appeal to Everybody, They Attract True Believers With a Spiky Point of View.
