# GISer's Weekly Issue 140, 2022-06-05

## GeoSpatial

1. [ArcGIS for Office](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-for-office/overview)

![](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/en-us/arcgis/products/maps-for-office/assets/overview-banner-hero-device-map-data.png)

ArcGIS for Office puts Excel data in the context of location. Use location intelligence to transform your graphs and charts into interactive maps directly in Microsoft Excel to see data from another perspective. Then use Microsoft PowerPoint to share your map.

2. [Has GIS Lost its Core Values?](https://www.gwprime.geospatialworld.net/opinion/has-gis-lost-its-core-values/)

From a hands-on perspective, GIS is becoming too complex, or the user interface (UI) is becoming too confusing.

What is missing today is a simpler GIS that is stripped back with just a simple user interface and the essential tools.

3. [MapTalks](https://maptalks.org/)

![](https://maptalks.org/resource/image/feature/3d.png)

Maptalks integrates 2D/3D maps by pitching and rotating 2D maps. So get one more dimension for mapping, visualizing and analyzing, with the simplicity of 2D maps.

4. [GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas)

GeoPandas is an open-source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed shapely.

## Research

1. [My guiding principles after 20 years of programming](https://alexewerlof.medium.com/my-guiding-principles-after-20-years-of-programming-a087dc55596c)

The author shares his 20 guiding programming principles accumulated over the 20 years.

- Get out of your comfort zone. Learn every day. Teach what you learn.
- Good code doesn't need documentation. Great code is well documented.
- Deprecate yourself. Don't be the go-to person for the code.
- Never start coding (making a solution) unless you fully understand the problem.
- Don't solve a problem that doesn't exist. Don't do speculative programming.
- `Pick the right tool for the job` or you'll have to find the right job for the tool you got.
- Any significant and rewarding piece of software results from `collaboration .`Communicate effectively and collaborate openly. Trust others and earn their trust. Respect people more than code. `Lead by example. Convert your followers to leaders`.
- You don't write the code for the machines, `you write it for your colleagues and your future self. Write it for the junior ones as a reference.
- Divide and conquer.
- Realize that every code has a life cycle and will die.
- Don't attach your identity to your code.
- Always read what you copy, and always audit what you import.
- Don't only write code for the optimistic scenario.
- When making decisions about the solution, all things equal, go for this priority:
  Security > Reliability > Usability (Accessibility & UX) > Maintainability > Simplicity (Developer experience/DX) > Brevity (code length) > Finance > Performance

2. [Optimizing Performance in React Apps](https://piyushsinha.tech/series/optimizing-react)

The author shares several tips and tricks to build an optimal React interface.

3. [The greatest threat to results are boredom and impatience](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-22-2022/)

**The only way to become good at something is to practice the everyday basics for an uncommon time.** Most people get bored. They want excitement. They want something to talk about, and no one talks about the boring basics. Boredom encourages you to stop doing what you know works and do something that might work.

Another way to mess up a good thing is to try and accelerate the natural pace of things into an unnatural one. A good idea taken to the extreme is always a bad idea.

It's hard to be above average if you can't find a way to do the same thing repeatedly.

In a world of social media, we glorify the results and not the process. We see the kick that knocked someone out but not the years of effort that went into perfecting it. We see the results, not the hard work.

**The difference between good and excellent results is often found in consistently doing the boring things you know you should do precisely when you feel like doing them the least.**

4. [How to Disagree](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html)

This essay by Paul Graham should be required reading not only as a citizen of the internet but also at work. As companies produce more written knowledge and have many conversations with tools like Slack, learning how to disagree is critical to creating a safe environment.

## Comments

1. As I came down from the mountain, I recalled how, not many years ago, it was access to information and movement that seemed our greatest luxury; nowadays it's often freedom from information, the chance to sit still, that feels like the ultimate prize. **Stillness** is not just an indulgence for those with enough resources-**it's a necessity for anyone who wishes to gather less visible resources.**
   --[Pico Iyer in The Art of Stillness](https://geni.us/pzKqxmH)

2. The person who carefully designs their daily routine goes further than the person that negotiates with themselves every day. The most successful people I know follow a routine to ensure the most important projects get the time they need.
   --[Negotiating with Yourself](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-29-2022/)

3. **Design the defaults and don't negotiate with yourself.** First, you must design your life so the default is to do the work. Second, and equally important, you can't negotiate with yourself.
   --[Negotiating with Yourself](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-29-2022/)

4. One of the most valuable skills you can adopt in life is doing things when you don't feel like doing them.
   --[Negotiating with Yourself](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-29-2022/)

5. It's better to treat ideas as relative, not absolute. Don't say: That's a bad idea. It will not work. That closes the door. Instead, try: Here's an interaction on that idea. It may be more likely to work. That opens new doors.

6. It's surprising how often startups will copy their competitor's features rather than talk to their users. The best startups understand that they cannot outsource one of the most important parts of building a successful product.
