Success. Everyone wants it, and we relentlessly compete with one another to get it. But what if I told you there was a different path you could take? Rather than succeeding by chasing prestige like everyone else, you could win by being "low status" instead?

Since big things start small, the highest status positions are generally reserved for people comfortable with being low status for a little while.

2. [How Philosophers Think](https://perell.com/essay/how-philosophers-think/)

## Comments

1. To keep learning and growing, we should always seek new perspectives. Appreciate music, food, and experiences we initially dislike. Read about subjects we know nothing about. Understand people we disagree with. Take on new challenges. Avoid routine.

2. A good photograph is knowing where to stand. You can easily double the quality of your photographs by spending a bit of time thinking about where to stand.

3. I think about this mechanism often - slow, persistent, and disciplined effort - and how it can lead to incredible results.

I know that there is no mechanism more powerful than persistence. This gives me comfort in the old adage, "just keep swimming."
