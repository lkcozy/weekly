It can be challenging to comprehend the true sizes of megacities or the global spread of 8 billion people, but this series of population density maps makes the picture abundantly clear.

Created using the EU's population density data and mapping tool Aerialod by Alasdair Rae, the 3D-rendered maps highlight demographic trends and geographic constraints.

3. [Why Product Development Requires Balancing Conflicting Goals](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/tension/)

This article describes the author's simple language to describe product development: opportunity, output, outcome, and impact. But more importantly, it describes the tensions and unexpected implications in the model.

**Learning to live with the tension inside the company and with customers is a skill worth learning rather than hoping to find a model to avoid it altogether.**

"Notice that what makes a product great are the things our customers and users say after they see it and try it. It's really up to them whether your product is great, not you. [...] **Paying attention to product outcomes is paying attention to how our customers get value from our product.**"

4. [Observations on 6 years of journaling](https://herman.bearblog.dev/years-of-journaling/)

There's a term in programming called "rubber-ducking" where, when struggling with a particularly difficult problem, a programmer sometimes turns to the person next to them and describes it (hoping the other person has a solution).

While describing the issue, the programmer will inadvertently solve their problem, say, "oh…never mind…", then turn around and keep working. Trying to describe and articulate the problem causes them to interrogate it more deeply.

This is referred to as "rubber-ducking" because the other person could easily have been replaced with a rubber duck.

In some ways, my journal is my rubber duck.

## Comments

1. Life is usually not a zero-sum game where someone needs to lose for others to win. Sometimes looking at others being successful is all you need to be inspired and push yourself further.
   --[Oren Ellenbogen](https://softwareleadweekly.com/issues/522)

2. But life is easier when you realize things are never so clear-cut. It's this and that, black and white, yes and no.

3. Good stuff scales with a lot of work and bad stuff scales with very little.
