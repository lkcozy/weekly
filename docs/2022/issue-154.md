This OGC Best Practice provides readers with guidance on using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) within the scope of OGC work.

These Best Practices do not seek to govern the use of UML within the OGC. However, the practices aim to provide guidance to assist in adherence to the following principles:

- Correctness — Adherence to the Object Management Group (OMG) UML standard.
- Consistency — UML artifacts should be consistent across OGC Standards and supporting standards such as those specified by ISO/TC 211.
- FAIRness — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable models.
- Value — Any modelling done, UML or otherwise, should add value to the parent standard.

1. [Focus to Win](https://fs.blog/focus-to-win/)

Anyone can say no to bad ideas, but only a focused person can say no to good ideas. Focus is about saying no.

Focus isn't a light switch you can turn on and off whenever you want to. It's something you have to practice every day.

Focus is hard, and because it's hard, it also creates a hidden place to find opportunities.

## Comments

1. The new engineering mantra should be: (1) Make it work (2) Make it safe (3) Make it fast. Security/Robustness needs to come earlier in the engineering conversation, and once you've sorted out performance as well, you've done 80% of what you need to "make it right".

2. Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.

3. A doctor once told me the biggest thing they don't teach in medical school is the difference between medicine and being a doctor — medicine is a biological science, while being a doctor is often a social skill of managing expectations, understanding the insurance system, communicating effectively, and so on.

4. Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.

5. A better formulation of DRY is SPOT (Single Point Of Truth). Definitions (code, data) that represent the same "truth", i.e. when one changes all have to change to represent a consistent truth, should be reduced to a single definition.
