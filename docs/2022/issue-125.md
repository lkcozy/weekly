Despite the pandemic changing how we conduct business, geospatial sensor manufacturers and technologies continued their upward trend, although more modestly than expected.

In this article, Dr. Qassim Abdullah revisited his predictions in geospatial trends made at this time last year, while looking ahead to what’s expected in the industry this year.

2. [Detecting Methane With Satellites](https://www.gislounge.com/detecting-methane-with-satellites/)

Methane is perhaps the most potent of greenhouse gas emissions. With increasing awareness of the importance in rapidly diminishing greenhouse gas emissions, scientists have focused on methane emissions as an area of concern.

Recent study has highlighted some major emission areas, mainly to do with pipelines used by the oil and gas sectors. These problems are, in many cases, easy to fix by properly fixing pipelines and not releasing methane.

However, to better limit methane emissions, more spatially sensitive satellites such as MethaneSAT, which can also be used to monitor emissions throughout the year, will be needed to monitor more sites and for longer periods.

3. [Semantic Sensor Network Ontology](https://w3c.github.io/sdw/ssn/)

![](https://w3c.github.io/sdw/ssn/images/modular_ontology.png)

The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is an ontology for describing sensors and their observations, the involved procedures, the studied features of interest, the samples used to do so, and the observed properties, as well as actuators.

SSN follows a horizontal and vertical modularization architecture by including a lightweight but self-contained core ontology called SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) for its elementary classes and properties.

4. [Sensor Integration Framework](https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=100078&version=1)

Sensor Integration Framework(SIF) provides a framework, a mediation service or services, to authorized users to integrate different sensors and access their data regardless of any concerns related to their technical constraints, such as sensor size, weight, power, communications capabilities, etc.

It proposes a set of Technical Views (TVs) to cover all deployment environments and their associated constraints, and a Reference View (RV). SIF is based on Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) assures the information flow between different TVs.

## Tool

Terence Tao, PhD, was studying university-level math by age 9. Now the “Mozart of Math” is breaking down his approach to everyday problem-solving—without complex equations or formulas. Learn how to deconstruct challenges, use storytelling as a tool, and discover solutions, whether you’re trying to level up in a computer game or just catch your plane on time.

TPM stands for Technical Program Manager. PM stands for Product Manager. EM stands for Engineering Manager.

The above pictures visualizes similarities and differences between the TPM role and other engineering leadership roles.

The TPM owns the ‘when?’ and ‘who?’ questions. The PM owns the ‘why?’ and ‘what?’ The EM and the engineering team own the ‘how?’.

2. [JavaScript package managers compared: npm, Yarn, or pnpm?](https://blog.logrocket.com/javascript-package-managers-compared/)

The goal of this article is to give you many perspectives to make a decision about which package manager to use on your own.

Three major players exist in the field of package managers today:

- npm
- Yarn — We will see shortly that Yarn can refer to either Yarn Classic (< v2), or its more modern version Yarn Berry (≥ v2)
- performant npm (pnpm)

Traditionally, npm and Yarn have installed dependencies in a flat node_modules folder.

pnpm has introduced some new concepts to store dependencies more efficiently in a nested node_modules folder.

Yarn Berry goes even further by ditching node_modules completely with its Plug’n’Play (PnP) mode.

1. Watching a lecture twice at double speed can benefit learning better than watching it once at normal speed

2. Don't invest too heavily in someone else's IP. Don't invest too heavily in someone else's API, either.
