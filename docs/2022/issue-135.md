Indoor mapping is a novel concept that uses a digital 2D or 3D map to visualize an indoor venue or geographic data.

To build indoor maps, developers can use Fabric.js with React to grasp the basic functionalities of the grid system, zooming, panning, and annotations.

Fabric.js is a powerful and simple JavaScript library that provides an interactive platform to work with React.

![NASA's world map illustrating the change in yearly average nitrogen dioxide concentrations from 2000 to 2019. The map was created using data from a land-use regression model and the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument.](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_809+q_glossy+ret_img+to_webp/https://www.gislounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/map-global-no2-2000-2019-nasa.jpg)

In an article discussing China's problem with NO2 before the pandemic, the authors of a recently published study demonstrated ground-based measures and satellite data using a cokriging interpolation technique. This method interpolates and uses different types of data sources of data to estimate NO2 in a given area.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a typical by-product of mainly diesel-powered vehicles, although factories and other sources also play an essential role in emissions.

1. [Seven tactics for resolving technical disagreements](https://www.cenizal.com/seven-tactics-for-resolving-technical-disagreements/)

Engineering is a team effort. But what do you do when you and a coworker have a technical disagreement and you can't seem to get anywhere?

Here are some tactics that I like to use to resolve technical disagreements.

- Strive for objectivity: Try to uncouple your ego from the discussion, so you don't feel threatened by other people's ideas.
- Take time to prepare your case: Discussions are not productive if your grasp of an idea is still fuzzy.
- Understand the other person's ideas and Points: Make a good-faith effort to see their point of view.
- Identify and acknowledge your assumptions
- Say you can convince me if list what things the other person needs to prove to make you change your mind
- Step away for a cool-off period. If the discussion gets heated, then emotion is probably interfering with your ability to think and communicate clearly
- Just build it: If the discussion doesn't seem to be getting anywhere, try proving your idea with code.

A long list of advice with something for everyone on the topic of money.

- Control of your time is the ultimate form of wealth.
- Money doesn't impress people. Your character does.
- Wealth is measured on calendars, not calculators.
- Money creates options. Options make life easier.
- Books are a great financial investment. Books go deep. Social media is shallow.
- Poverty makes you good at managing expenses. Everything has an upside.
- Every purchase you make steals a little bit of your time.

2. Setting expectations is one of the most important things anyone can do. The sooner, the better. It helps the people around us to be at their best, even with a lack of guidance. Building the right culture is the most important job of the CEO.

3. You can tell how good someone is making decisions by how much time they have. Busy people spend a lot of time correcting poor decisions, so they don't have time to make good decisions. Good decisions need good thinking, and that requires time.
