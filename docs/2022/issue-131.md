Pipelines are the primary method of transporting crude oil worldwide, delivering oil and its derivative products swiftly to refineries and empowering reliant businesses.

And North America is a major oil hub. The U.S. and Canada alone are home to more than 90,000 miles of crude oil and petroleum product pipelines and more than 140 refineries that can process around 20 million barrels of oil every day.

Automated techniques that read data from scanned pictures have made significant advances in recent years. On the other hand, map data has seen minimal development up to this point.

These techniques are able to recognize and search for place names, but they also provide us with the capacity to retrieve data that has been virtually absent from current maps.

Most people suck at managing up (how to get what you want & give your boss what they need). They waste their boss' time with too much (or too little) information.

Here are some ways to give your boss the right amount of context:

- Remind them where you left off.
- Be specific & explicit about what you need.
- Mention if it's an FYI.
- Adopt an action-oriented posture.
- Mention your criteria and assumptions.
- Put the recommendation at the top, then context below.

3. [What You Give Up When Moving Into Engineering Management](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/02/23/what-you-give-up-when-moving-into-engineering-management/)

Far too many engineers take a management role without understanding the tradeoffs, and many end up unhappy because of it. If you want to become a manager, be aware that you'll have to forgo some of what you probably like most about your field.

- Focus time: Because context switching is so costly, most engineers crave focus time.
- Short feedback cycles: Management doesn't yield instantaneous results.
- Conflict avoidance: Having difficult conversations is a huge part of being a manager
- Making technical decisions: Your product as a manager is people.
- Learning new technical skills: Have less time to devote to acquiring new tech skills.

Knowledge is only potential power. Knowledge x Application = Power.

## Comments

1. The question I found most impactful to ask when I get a document to review is What kind of feedback would you like me to give?

2. Free education is abundant, all over the internet. It's the desire to learn that's scarce.

3. Throughout the free software community, an unbridled aura of justified mistrust fills the air: mistrust of large corporations, mistrust of governments. Each mistrust is connected by a critical thread: centralization. Thus, permeating the community are calls for decentralization.
