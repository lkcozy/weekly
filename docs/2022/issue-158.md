Your GIS analysis quality mainly depends on the quality of the acquired dataset. When mapping data is involved, Open Street Map (OSM) is an invaluable resource. While map providers like Google and Mapbox maintain an equally resourceful database, Open Street Map remains a preferred option for two main reasons:

- Open Street Map is OPEN
- OSM's Access and Coverage

This guide provides detailed steps on the kinds of data you might need from the OSM database and the different extraction methods.

2. [The 3 Billion People Who Can't Afford a Healthy Diet](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-the-3-billion-people-cant-afford-a-healthy-diet/)

![](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cost-of-a-healthy-diet.jpg)

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 3 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, an additional 112 million more than in 2019.

The (un)affordability is measured by comparing the cost of a healthy diet to income levels in the country. If the cost exceeds **52%** of an average household's income, the diet is deemed unaffordable.

3. [Metaverse And GIS](https://mapscaping.com/metaverse-and-gis/)

Metaverse can be defined as

> A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.

**What does the metaverse mean for GIS?**

- real-time rendered, synchronous, continuous
- digital twins: the virtual representation of a real-world physical asset, often updated in real-time to reflect changes to itself and its environment.
- virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
- data standardization: the data in the metaverse must be standardized to enable interoperability.

4. [What is the Difference Between GIS and Geospatial?](https://www.gislounge.com/difference-gis-geospatial/)

![](https://cityofdelta.net/sites/default/files/styles/full_node_primary_extra_wide/public/imageattachments/planning/page/2321/what_is_gis.jpg?itok=v2BgZuFg)

The terms GIS (which most commonly is an acronym for Geographic Information Systems) and geospatial are often used interchangeably. However, there are differences in what the terms GIS and geospatial mean.

**GIS is a system** for performing geospatial analysis and analytics.

**Geospatial is a term used to define the collective data and associated technology has a geographic or locational component.**

Geospatial is a concatenation of 'geography' and 'spatial .'The addition of 'geo' indicates that the focus is on features relating to Earth. Geo stems from the Greek "geō," which means the Earth.

Geospatial technology is used to acquire, manipulate, and store geographic information. GIS is one form of geospatial technology.

3. [μFuzzy](https://github.com/leeoniya/uFuzzy)

![](https://github.com/leeoniya/uFuzzy/raw/main/uFuzzy.png)

uFuzzy is a fuzzy search library designed to match a relatively short search phrase (needle) against a large list of short-to-medium phrases (haystack). It might be best described as a more forgiving String.indexOf(). Common use cases are list filtering, auto-complete/suggest, and title/name/description/filename/function searches.

1. [Larry Page on Thinking Big](https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1576944152482570241)

This short video provides a great insight that people often confuse with reading too many Agile or Lean Startup books. The focus is not only on the start small and iterating quickly but also on being able to articulate a destination worth iterating towards. If you're working on internal products where the customer is friendly, available, and, let's be honest - has a vendor lock-in - you should be cautious thinking about the job to be done and how you envision it x10 times better than today.

1. [How to Be a 10x Software Engineer](https://medium.com/@_michaellin/how-to-be-a-10x-engineer-fdac2a5a1bd5)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*xQ81A11_SHnuz9IZfBuK6g.jpeg)

10x software engineers aren't typing 10x faster, working 10x the hours, and writing 10x more code. Instead, 10x engineers might type at half the speed, work half the amount, and spend more time DELETING code rather than writing it.

**What separates the best engineers from the average ones are the non-technical skills.**

The difference between the best and junior engineers boils down to an issue of mindset. They use the right tools, ask the right questions, and know how to prioritize. Skills that have little to do with coding that even non-technical people can develop.

Here are three common mistakes junior engineers make and how a senior engineer would tackle the same problem differently.

- Not investigating tooling enough. A junior engineer will spend 8 hours chopping with a dull axe. The senior engineer spends an hour picking the right chainsaw.
- Not asking for help: a less experienced engineer who knows how to ask for help will always beat a more talented engineer who never asks for help.
- Not delivering business value: 10x engineers are investors first and foremost. Engineers must weigh opportunity costs. Of all features you could build-is this feature the best use of your time?

Engineers have to deliver value first and foremost.

3. If you want to build a great product, think of if like a secret sauce. It's a specific combination of a handful of ingredients. Too many ingredients make it a mess. Too few and it's not unique. Most people (myself included) definitely err on the side of too many. I find I have to force myself to add fewer ingredients.
