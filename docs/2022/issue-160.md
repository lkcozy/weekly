The system also provides a VR desktop, where you can wear a headset and have five monitors on your desk. So if this works, you won't have to go to the office.

Web 1.0 - Read Only
Between 1991 and 2004, the internet is like a catalogue of static pages. We can browse the content by jumping from one hyperlink to another. However, it doesn't provide any interactions with the content.

Web 2.0 - Read Write
From 2004 to now, the internet has evolved to have search engines, social media apps, and recommendation algorithms backed apps.

Because the apps digitalize human behaviours and persist user data when users interact with these apps, big companies leverage user data for advertisements, which becomes one of the main business models in Web 2.0.

People say the apps know you better than your friends, family, or even yourself.

Web 3.0 - Read Write Own
The idea has been discussed recently due to the development of blockchain and decentralized apps. The creators' content is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and owned by the users. If apps want to access the data, they need to get authorization from the users and pay for it.

In Web 3.0, the ownership change may lead to some major innovations.

## AI/ML

1. [Deep Learning Interviews book](https://github.com/BoltzmannEntropy/interviews.ai)

![](https://github.com/BoltzmannEntropy/interviews.ai/raw/main/assets/cover-amazon-print2.png)

The Deep Learning Interviews is home to hundreds of fully-solved problems from a wide range of critical topics in AI. It is designed to both rehearse interview or exam-specific issues and provide machine learning M.Sc./Ph.D. students and those awaiting an interview with a well-organized overview of the field. The problems it poses are tough enough to cut your teeth on and to improve your skills-but dramatically. They're framed with thought-provoking questions and engaging stories.

## Research

1. [How can I further improve my skills in evaluating a research paper?](https://writemyresearchpaper.quora.com/How-to-further-improve-my-skills-in-evaluating-a-research-paper)

Read as many papers in your field as possible and, of course, publish as many articles as possible. Meanwhile, you will realize how experienced researchers think about finding and publishing new results.

## Tool

1. [React Table Library](https://github.com/table-library/react-table-library)

React Table Library -- an almost headless table library -- which prioritizes:

- opt-in feature-richness
- built-in themes and custom theming
- server-side operations as first-class citizens
- small library size
- pleasant developer experience
- TypeScript support
- SSR support

2. [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)

Keep your application settings in sync.

3. [Maigret](https://github.com/soxoj/maigret)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soxoj/maigret/main/static/recursive_search.svg)

Maigret only collects a dossier on a person by username, checking for accounts on a huge number of sites and gathering all the available information from web pages. No API keys required.

## Resources

1. [My 2-Step Rule for Having Hard Conversations at Work](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/18/microsoft-exec-my-2-step-rule-for-having-hard-conversations-at-work.html)

"Being curious and asking questions can help defuse negative emotions and keep tensions from rising. Pausing before responding and listening to what the other person has to say also shows the other person that you want to work together toward a solution and can move the conversation forward."

Learning to control our emotions and reactions is a skill we have to nurture if we want to increase our impact level in the organization.

Writing (email or gdoc) and iterating on it until it's "clear, crisp and calm" is excellent advice to control our messaging and think carefully about the outcome we seek.

2. [Aging Programmer](https://world.hey.com/jorge/aging-programmer-d448bdec)

Jorge Manrubia wrote an honest and inspiring post on the qualities of becoming more mature and experienced in our industry as a programmer.

3. [Algorithms for Competitive Programming](https://cp-algorithms.com/)

This project aims to translate the wonderful resource http://e-maxx.ru/algo which provides descriptions of many algorithms and data structures, especially popular in competitive programming. Moreover, we want to improve the collected knowledge by extending the articles and adding new articles to the collection.

4. [Awesome Diagramming](https://github.com/shubhamgrg04/awesome-diagramming)

A curated collection of diagramming tools used by leading software engineering teams.

## Comments

1. The skill that levels up the most at a start-up: learning how to learn. So humbling; a daily ego beating. But man does it compound.

2. Culture is built upon what your team experiences all day, every day at workâ€”not what they experience when they step away from the normal routine for a workshop, keynote, or holiday party.
