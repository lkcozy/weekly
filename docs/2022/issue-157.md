1. [Reflections on the 2022 Joint OGC & ISO Code Sprint - The Metadata Code Sprint](https://www.ogc.org/blog/4790)

![A high-level overview of the architecture of the OGC ISO 2022 Metadata Code Sprint](https://www.ogc.org/pub/www/files/blog/MetadSprintBlog_architecture.jpg)

Over the past two decades, standards such as OGC Catalog Services for the Web(CSW) have been integrated into several Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) initiatives at national and international levels.

In recent times, the uptake of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)and Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) has necessitated the modernization of existing metadata and catalogue approaches.

This code sprint served to accelerate the support of open geospatial standards that relates to geospatial metadata and catalogues.

2. [OGC Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG)](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-feat-geo-json)

The OGC Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG) Standard extends GeoJSON to support a limited set of additional capabilities that are out of scope for GeoJSON but essential for a variety of use cases involving feature data.

GeoJSON has become a viral encoding and is supported in most deployments of APIs implementing OGC API Features, but it has limitations that prevent or limit its use in some cases.

3. [Integrated representation of geospatial data, model, and knowledge for digital twin railway](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17538947.2022.2127949?af=R)

![](https://www.tandfonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/tandf/journals/content/tjde20/2022/tjde20.v015.i01/17538947.2022.2127949/20220927/images/medium/tjde_a_2127949_f0001_oc.jpg)

Context: The accurate real-time description of all spatial features of the railway and their spatiotemporal relationships is a crucial factor in realizing comprehensive management and related decision-making within the entire life cycle of railways.

Challenge: Nevertheless, available spatiotemporal data models mainly use static historical sequence data, which are insufficient to support multi-source heterogeneous real-time sensed data. They lack a systematic depiction of the interactive relationships among multiple feature entities and are limited to low-level descriptive analysis.

This study **proposes a data-model-knowledge integrated representation data model for a digital twin railway**, which explicitly describes the spatiotemporal and interaction relationships among railway features through a conceptual knowledge graph.

## Research

1. [How did you develop your Ph.D. proposal?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-you-develop-your-Ph-D-proposal)

- Go to Google scholar and research the recent papers in your area of interest.
- First, read them thoroughly, especially the abstract and the conclusion, and identify the gaps that research couldn't fulfil. Some/Most of the papers explicitly state the gaps they couldn't fill in with their research.
- You got a new research problem(s) now! Google it again and see whats the current and past research on it (most cited papers etc).
- Come up with an idea and its respective references supporting your idea in solving that problem.
- Email your prospective PhD supervisor(s) of this idea with references (2–4 only), and ask for his feedback/suggestions.
- Based on that and your further research, develop a proposal and submit - with/without funding.
- Once you get admitted, you will start working on your proposal. But do remember that you will have to make some changes in your proposed research as you go along your PhD. The proposed research and your thesis work might not always be exactly the same, except the outline. So be prepared to change and work for the better.

1. [Why TDD(test-driven development) doesn't work](https://medium.com/@bsemaj/when-tdd-test-driven-development-doesnt-work-64ce0936611c)

**Because if you truly wrote out 100% of your tests, you may find, after writing the code, that only 50% of those tests are applicable.**

As you write, your brain comes up with new ways to streamline, shortcuts, or sometimes even completely different ways that are better.

The more you write, the more you change!

Solutions: `Code first and then write most important tests.`

TDD works in some cases for smaller feature builds where the scope is super narrow, and you're assured that the code won't have to change.

2. [How I Interview Engineers to Assess Ability to Deliver Impact](https://www.metaview.ai/resources/blog/how-i-interview-engineers-to-assess-ability-to-deliver-impact)

Siadhal Magos shares a great framework to go deeper in interviews to assess the impact level the candidate seeks to achieve and is capable of. The framework can be used to drive existing employees to be more impact-driven, so steal it away and share it with your teammates.

3. [The Leader's Journal: Become an Inspiring Leader in Ten Minutes a Day](https://leaddev.com/leadership-skills/leaders-journal-become-inspiring-leader-ten-minutes-day)

"While a developer can push code to Git and receive instant feedback from his peers, there's no PR process for a leader's decisions, insights, or creations. Our Impact isn't easily measured."

Ofir Sharony covers how he uses journaling to iterate on his Impact as a manager and find a better balance to avoid burnout.

4. [Guiding Principle: Think Big, Work Small](https://jchyip.medium.com/guiding-principle-think-big-work-small-8fb1fce6dd97)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*nMGnnUl-dyIxd1L3RH6UQA.png)

Think Big, Work Small. There is a coherent, bigger-picture strategy. Work is done incrementally and iteratively.

"Think Small, Work Small is a typical mistake for Agile novices." -- Jason Yip captures the common pitfall of the planning <> execution most teams and companies fall into. Thing Big (Roadmap, Milestones, ADRs) and Work Small (usable releases) is easy to say yet hard to execute, but a muscle team should learn to develop.

> Thinking Big does not mean defining all the details up-front but rather just enough breadth and depth to convey the overall context to allow autonomous teams to operate effectively.

## Comments

1. The Internet is great at organizing information and making you find things you like. If you express your true interests, this magical force will introduce you to like minded people. These people will become some of your best friends, colleagues and sometimes even lovers. They will make your life more interesting and fulfilling.
