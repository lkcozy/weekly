That leaves about 7.7 billion people—roughly 99% of us—on the side of the planet illuminated by the Sun. Only less than 80 million people were at night.

Over 6.4 billion are in the daytime, while more than 1.2 billion people experience twilight.

3. [Planning for Project Deadlines So You Can Sleep at Night](https://www.buildthestage.com/planning-for-project-deadlines-so-you-can-sleep-at-night/)

A good framework to consider when analyzing a project you need to lead. Trying to break down the project and putting not only a rough estimation but also some level of confidence (1 to 5) if you can parallelize it (e.g. putting two people on the task) is very helpful. You can also add another column to understand if you can effectively get help on the effort from a different team (while keeping ownership).

4. [A Staff-Shaped Hole](https://squanderingti.me/blog/2022/06/29/a-staff-shaped-hole.html)

Chris Chandler wrote a post to help you observe and analyze your organization, identifying some missing elements worth your investment. Share it with your leadership team (tech and managers) and discuss your observations. Where do you want to put more focus? How will you know it works better other than Chris's questions? What will you measure (to drive incentives)?

5. [Three Part Solution to Leaders Burnout: Fundamental Principles Don't Change](https://jjude.com/leaders-burnout/)

Teach, delegate and handle the toughest cases. Good framing to keep a sustainable career as a leader: "Delegation doesn't mean abdication. Leaders should still handle the toughest of the cases. When done well, it does two wonderful things: Leaders are often detached from the daily activities of their units or companies; [...] The leaders will remain informed of the company's activities by handling a few cases. By still handling cases a leader can keep their skill sharp and current. Leaders who solve the toughest cases lead by example. Others can learn from them. Other members know that the leader is still on the field playing and they take courage from their example."

## Comments

1. Never make your value as a human being conditioned on the results of what you're trying to achieve. Never do that. One of the critical points is to live your own life. And by the way, when you live in the past, you're living someone else's life too.
   --[Marshall Goldsmith: The Essentials Of Leadership](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/marshall-goldsmith/)

2. Our mission in life is to make a positive difference, not to prove we're smart and not to prove we're right. We are not here on earth to prove how smart we are. We are not here on earth to prove how right we are.
   --[Marshall Goldsmith: The Essentials Of Leadership](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/marshall-goldsmith/)

3. Few things are as destructive and limiting as a worldview that assumes people are mostly rational.

4. Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.

6. Feeling overwhelmed? Take a shower. Feeling uninspired? Take a walk. Feeling lonely? Work at a coffee shop. Feeling sad? Call a friend. Feeling uncertain? Write it out.
