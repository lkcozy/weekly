Machine learning techniques are becoming more ubiquitous in our everyday lives and research.

Researchers have also demonstrated that there could be ways to improve data gaps by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the quality of data and predictability. While GANs are known for their applicability in creating images, sometimes even fake images, GANs can also be used to derive data which can then be used in the training of machine learning maps using two competitive networks that compare a derived dataset to an empirical dataset.

## Research

1. [Biometric Authentication by Grinding Your Teeth](https://www.unite.ai/biometric-authentication-by-grinding-your-teeth/)

Two recent research papers from the US and China have proposed a novel solution for teeth-based authentication: grind or bite your teeth a bit, and an ear-worn device (an 'earable' that may also double up as a regular audio listening device) will recognize the unique aural pattern produced by rubbing your dental architecture and generate a valid biometric 'pass' to a suitably equipped challenge system.

2. [The Color of Infinite Temperature](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2022/01/16/the-color-of-infinite-temperature/)

## Comments

1. I am a pessimist by nature. Many people can only keep on fighting when they expect to win. I'm not like that, I always expect to lose. I fight anyway, and sometimes I win.
   --[Richard Stallman](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2022/05/weekly-issue-206.html)

2. Happiness is having nowhere else to be.
