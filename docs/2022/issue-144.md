![STAplus extension to Datastream](../../images/issue-144-1.jpg)

The STAplus introduces three features: ownership, license and group.

The first part of the STAplus extension offers to operate an existing deployment with the concept of ownership: A STAplus deployment enables authenticated users to manage their objects (things, sensors, observations, etc.).

By associating licenses with their contributions (sensor readings made available as observations), it is possible to ensure proper re-use.

The second important innovation that STAplus offers is the ability to make relationships between observations explicit. The Relation concept of the extensions allows the implementation of performant convenience API functions that support semantic queries.

Third and finally, the Group concept of STAplus enables the creation of bags or sets by creating collections of observations via linking or deep copy. This

## Comments

1. Prioritization is a political problem as much as an analytical problem.
   --[Richard Mironov](https://www.mironov.com/pri-politics/)

2. The great thing about working in tech is that there are always new problems to solve, new markets to create, and new products to ship. The macro events don't change that. So focus yourself and your team on building and shipping those things, get some wins, and move forward with optimism and positive energy. It will be infectious.

3. The difference between great and bad projects is not headcount – it's leadership. It's easy to mix the two because great projects tend to have more headcount. But that's only true because these projects were going well, and the company decided to double down on them.

4. If you're a leader who is scared of the changes that remote work will bring, I challenge you to make the necessary cultural shifts, adjust your organization's workflows, and overcome the biggest remote workplace barrier: yourself.
