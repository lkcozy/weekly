Dr. Liang shared his thoughts about how the open geospatial data standards for IoT data and integrated sensor web can help detect, repair and prevent methane emissions.

Methane is invisible but is one of the most potent greenhouse gases affecting climate change. Methane emissions are caused by agriculture, oil and gas.

Multiple types of methane sensors have to work together based on their different temporal and spatial-temporal scales at varying levels of accuracy.

`Handheld instruments` are good at determining the exact source but bad at detecting early leaks.

`Fixed, in-situ sensors` can tell the possible leaks in a specific direction depending on the wind direction and speed.

`Terrestrial mobile methane mapping systems` are mounted to vehicles to collect inaccurate area detection data.

`Airborne systems` use LiDAR(light detection and ranging) and various other sniffers to provide short-term temporal detection.

`Satellites` provide temporal monitoring with extensive coverage. But it's unable to identify which device is leaking.

Forests cover nearly one-third of the land globally. Yet, more than half (54 percent) of the world's forests are in only five countries â€“ the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China.

A Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure used to test whether an item is a member of a set. Bloom filters are space-efficient because they do not store copies of the objects themselves. This comes with the tradeoff of being probabilistic.

Probabilistic data structures are data structures that are cleverly designed to answer questions about a large dataset without querying the entire dataset directly.

The underlying data structure of Bloom filters is a bit array.
The hash functions' bits at the output of the position are toggled to 1 when adding items.

Processing data sets on a large scale can be a time-consuming and overwhelming experience. Probabilistic data structures are beneficial tools to solve this challenge.

2. [The Architecture of a Web 3.0 application](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/the-architecture-of-a-web-3-0-application#/)

Unlike Web 2.0 applications, Web 3.0 eliminates the middle man. There's no centralized database that stores the application state, and there's no centralized web server where the backend logic resides.

Instead, you can leverage blockchain to build apps on a decentralized state machine maintained by anonymous nodes on the internet.

No single entity controls this decentralized state machine; everyone in the network collectively maintains it.

In Web 3.0, you can write smart contracts that define the logic of your applications and deploy them onto the decentralized state machine.

In this article, the author will show you exactly how to learn to become a blockchain, solidity, and smart contract engineer, from beginner to professional.

## Comments

1. As a senior engineer, you should learn how to be less reactionary and more strategic. Reactionary behaviour creates tactical solutions. Tactical solutions create more problems. Learning to think big and fix foundational issues sometimes makes hard problems disappear.

2. Your writing is the clearest indicator of how you think. That's why it's the highest leverage skill you can master.

3. The front end is much more difficult. Why? Because that's what the users see - it is the application as far as the users are concerned. Difficult in this context isn't referring to technical difficulty; it's the difficulty of having to deal with the end-users and all the problems that entail. From a technical perspective, the front end is also moving faster, so there's more churn and more things to keep up with. Finally, there's less research. Front-end development hasn't benefited from decades of academic research.

4. Some people enjoy the messiness of the front end and the constant technology churn. Some people prefer the stability of the technology stack on the back end and not having to deal so much with end-users.
