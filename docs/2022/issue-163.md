## GeoSpatial

1. [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/)

GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information.

A GeoPackage is built as an extended SQLite 3 database file (\*.gpkg) containing data and metadata tables with specified definitions, integrity assertions, format limitations and content constraints.

2. [Light Pollution](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/)

![](https://imgs.zhubai.love/22d96568929d417e9f22b3d1e64b3220.png)

This mapping application displays light pollution-related content over Microsoft Bing base layers (road and hybrid Bing maps). The primary use was to show VIIRS/DMSP data in a friendly manner. Still, over the many years, it also received some other exciting light pollution-related content like SQM/SQC measurements, World Atlas 2015 zenith brightness, almost real-time clouds, aurora prediction and IAU observatories features.

One benefit of getting a Ph.D. that is often overlooked relates to the various skills are capabilities you acquire. These skills and capabilities can be applied in multiple aspects of life.

The said skills are inclusive of, but they are not limited to:

- problem-solving and critical thinking skills
- superior communication skills
- better information gathering and analysis abilities

There is also the additional discipline-specific knowledge you acquire after getting your Ph.D. Thus, a Ph.D. could immensely contribute to your continued development as a person and professional.

3. [safe-json-value](https://github.com/ehmicky/safe-json-value)

Prevents `JSON.serialize()` from throwing an exception, changing types, or otherwise transforming values unexpectedly because sometimes you need that sort of reassurance.

4. [XRender](https://github.com/alibaba/x-render)

A powerful solution for rendering form/table/chart.

- FormRender： use the form as if it was an input
- TableRender： protocol generation & highly flexible search list
- ChartRender： chart library for dummies
- FormGenerator： a sharp tool for building visualized forms i

The playground makes that easier by loading datasets and then guiding you step by step through an exercise practically leveraging that dataset.

## Resources

1. [Learning good habits by watching a staff software consultant](https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2022-11-09-what-i-learned-watching-a-staff-consultant/)

The first week of this engagement has served as a template for our work over the first month with the client.

- Iterating on the process of getting tasks done, defining or redefining the MVP
- Staying focused on having a goal that we can complete
- Exploring options and researching to clarify the next steps
- Tracking those next steps somewhere visible to the whole team
- Working openly in public

2. [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep32-how-does-grpc-work)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4138b20e-ac72-40a7-a753-cfb1916be3c0_1336x1012.jpeg)

DDD was introduced in Eric Evans' classic book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software ."It explained a methodology to model a complex business. This book contains a lot of content, so I'll summarize the basics.

The composition of domain objects:

- Entity: a domain object that has an ID and life cycle.
- Value Object: a domain object without ID. It is used to describe the property of the Entity.
- Aggregate: a collection of Entities that are bounded together by an Aggregate Root (which is also an entity). It is the unit of storage.

## Comments

1. The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character-that is the goal of true education.
   --[Martin Luther King](https://qr.ae/pvjGUv)

2. For managers and team leads, this study also offers ways to improve team productivity: focus team awareness (developers were found to have a lack of awareness about their team's work and progress), and recognize the need for engagement within the team (developers gauge their team's productivity by their own interactions with the group).
