> The first is cultivating a sense of ownership and responsibility beyond your specific work or your immediate team's work.
> You don't have to do everything (you're only one person), but it is your responsibility to triage if it's worth doing and if so, make sure that it's on someone's backlog to do.

2. [13 Hard-Earned Lessons to Skyrocket Your Career](https://nitter.net/adcock_brett/status/1603050437094961153)

- Dedicate time to daily study: make goals to improve in manageable increments.
- Teach what you study: sharing your new knowledge will make it stick
- Envelop yourself in data: Be data-driven. Analyze instead of theorizing. Know the data related to your role.
- Build a process for everything: document how you do every major function. Prepare the processes and playbooks for your replacement.
- Learn about your coworkers: learn about their lives and how they like to work. You'll advance so much more when you have better relationships.
- Get quick wins weekly: Identify low-hanging fruit to get on the scoreboard each week.
- Triple-down on strengths: know what you're great at and figure out ways to 10X that greatness. This is much more crucial than improving a weakness.
- Default to executing: you default to providing solutions and getting work done. When in doubt: execute.
- Do what you said you'd do: remember your promises. And over-deliver on them. Don't be someone who has great ideas but doesn't bring them to life.
- Show your ability to be decisive: Show your leaders that you can make tough choices — quickly

3. [The Gordian Knot of Identity and Achievement](https://radreads.co/identity-achievement/)

"If you had a manager that talked to you the way you talked to you, you'd quit." -- Many of us tend to look down on ourselves. Trying to get more things done without being successful. Trying to read more. To build more. To spend more time with our loved ones. To find new hobbies and form new habits. If you cannot be the "manager you need" for yourself, surround yourself with optimistic, empathic friends that can remind you how awesome you are. That's the greatest hack of all.

## Comments

1. You can become happier by doing a series of activities that make people happy in general. Practicing gratitude can indeed make you happier.

2. When you're overwhelmed with problems, ordering them isn't the most important skill, filtering them is. The better way to measure progress is to ignore the problems and think about what we've built. What things can we do today that we couldn't yesterday?

3. "I'm on it" is a powerful statement. It doesn't mean we don't need help or will work on it in complete isolation. It signals that you'll take care of the job to be done and deliver the desired outcome. There is a no better response to create a sense of high agency. Now do what you said, and people will route bigger and bigger challenges your way.

4. Entrepreneurship is like one of those carnival games where you throw darts or something.

Middle-class kids can afford one throw. Most miss. A few hit the target and get a small prize. A very few hit the center bullseye and get a bigger prize. Rags to riches! The American Dream lives on.

Rich kids can afford many throws. If they want to, they can try over and over and over again until they hit something and feel good about themselves. Some keep going until they hit the center bullseye, then they give speeches or write blog posts about "meritocracy" and the salutary effects of hard work.

Poor kids aren't visiting the carnival. They're the ones working it.

5. Depth of understanding is the gateway to efficiency. Not the other way around.
