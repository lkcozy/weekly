3. [Mapping China's offshore mariculture based on dense time-series optical and radar data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17538947.2022.2108923?af=R)

![](https://www.tandfonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/tandf/journals/content/tjde20/2022/tjde20.v015.i01/17538947.2022.2108923/20220808/images/medium/tjde_a_2108923_f0008_oc.jpg)

Chinese scientists produced a high-precision Chinese mariculture distribution map for 2020 based on a newly developed mariculture extraction method. This method combined dense time-series and multi-source remote sensing data.

The results showed that the total area of China's mariculture was significantly more significant than the previous studies, with Shandong province having the largest proportion.

In addition, China's mariculture presented a spatial distribution characteristic of denser north and sparser south, and 60 % of mariculture was located in the coastal zones of the northern provinces.

Finally, this study demonstrates that mariculture areas obtained by remote sensing observations have significant potential for estimating production.

Further analysis and evaluation of the water quality, physical environmental, socio-economic, and distance to industries can be carried out in the future.

## Comments

1. An executive is (or should be), a person who makes happen what needs to happen. This implies the skills of an executive are determining what needs to happen and knowing how to make it so. Seems simple, but it isn't, at all.

2. Just as eating contrary to the inclination is injurious to the health, so study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing it takes in.

3. Planning is for doing. The only purpose of a plan is to ensure better results, it has no value in itself. We must know what to overlook, as sometimes it is better to have no plan at all.
