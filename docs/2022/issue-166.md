Google maps' street view but for Zelda Breath of The Wild. The author explains how he made it by [AutoStich](http://matthewalunbrown.com/autostitch/autostitch.html), which is an image-stitching software tool for creating panoramas, [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org/), which is a lightweight panorama viewer for the web, and [Cemu](https://cemu.info/), which is a Will U Emulator.

2. [Essentials of Geographic Information Systems](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_essentials-of-geographic-information-systems/index.html)

Essentials of Geographic Information Systems illustrates how GIS is used to ask questions, inform choices, and guide policy. From melting the polar ice caps to privacy issues associated with mapping, this book provides a gentle yet substantive introduction to the use and application of digital maps, mapping, and GIS.

## AI/ML

1. [Peregrine](https://play.ht/blog/introducing-truly-realistic-text-to-speech-with-emotion-and-laughter/)

Peregrine is an ultra-realistic Text to Speech model for the missing modality in that new set of models, which is Generative Audio.

The future is AI-generated. We believe in a future where all content creation will be generated by AI but guided by humans. The most creative work will depend on the human ability to articulate their desired creation to the model.

2. [Adobe Podcast](https://pages.adobe.com/shasta/)

Adobe Podcast(a.k.a, Project Shasta) is an AI-powered audio recording and editing. It lets you easily edit audio using a transcript.

## Tool

1. [GraphQL Query Builder](https://github.com/atulmy/gql-query-builder)

```ts
import \* as gql from 'gql-query-builder'
const query = gql.query({
operation: 'thoughts',
fields: ['id', 'name', 'thought']
})
console.log(query)
// Output
query {
thoughts {
id,
name,
thought
}
}

```

A simple helper function to generate GraphQL queries using plain JavaScript Objects (JSON).

Similar to [json-to-graphql-query](https://github.com/vkolgi/json-to-graphql-query#readme)

2. [AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript)

A suite of utilities for AWS Lambda Functions that makes structured logging, creating custom metrics asynchronously and tracing with AWS X-Ray easier

1. [Technical Debt Cripples Productivity](https://abinoda.substack.com/p/tech-debt-productivity)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd427365-e95c-47b8-885e-191627280e8c_1600x1213.png)

This paper provides a path for engineering to help leadership understand the "reality on the ground." Framing the problem in terms of "time wasted" is one way to get the message across so that leadership either invests in improving the problem or gets comfortable with the reality and forecasts delivery schedules accordingly.

- Developers waste 23% of their working time due to technical debt.
- Wasted time is most commonly spent performing additional testing.
- Code-related, testing and architectural issues are most strongly correlated with wasted time.
- Developers are largely aware of the time wasted due to technical debt. However, managers are not as aware

Technical debt is a metaphor that was created to] describe the need to recognize the potential long-term negative effects of immature code during the software development lifecycle.

Interest is the negative effect of the extra effort and activities that have to be paid due to the accumulated amount of TD in the system.

This extra effort is described as waste, or "any activity that produces no value for the customer," thus negatively affecting developer productivity.

This debt potentially has to be repaid with interest in the long term.

2. [Developer Productivity at Google](https://abinoda.substack.com/p/developer-productivity-at-google)

Engineers and DevEx teams might inherently understand that factors like code quality affect productivity but don't have the data to support that notion. This paper provides that evidence.

- Perceived productivity is causally related to satisfaction with code quality. Perceived productivity is also causally associated with satisfaction with technical debt.

- Engineers who reported their tools and infrastructure were not innovative were likelier to report lower productivity.

- Engineers hindered by shifting project priorities were likely to report lower productivity.

## Comments

1. I wish I were a couple of inches shorter. Hardly any super tall person lives over 100 years old, yet many shorter ones do (even after correcting for the height distribution at birth). The heart has to work harder for tall people, and eventually it requires maintenance, or it fails.

2. The story is about how we choose beliefs because they're useful, not true.

3. Leadership is inspiring people. Management is keeping the trains running on time. Recently someone pointed out that it is a rare human who is both a great leader and a great manager. A leader who is so busy that he cannot manage his own calendar proves to be one of the two.
