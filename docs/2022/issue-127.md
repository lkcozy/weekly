The nature of GIS is heavily intertwined with the world of design. Maps are a user interface and a user experience, serving as a visual tool to communicate and provide insight into a specific region and subject.

Jeff Siarto of Element 84 discusses with the MapScaping Podcast `how design is present and changing in the geospatial industry.`

A key aspect of designing an experience for a GIS application is `understanding of the audience .`Who will be using the map, and what will they use it for? Planning to predict and meet the needs of your niche provides a superior user experience with a higher chance of creating a returning customer.

Dror Poleg with an interesting formula: [The level of in-person interaction] multiplied by [the size of the talent pool] equals [The rate of innovation and financial success]. Maybe the right way to think about it is that the talent pool's size becomes more important as the company matures. While it's still pre Product Market Fit, the level of in-person interaction might be more critical.

## Comments

1. Stop calling meetings so you can simply organize your own thoughts with witnesses.

2. The best part of free software is it sometimes produces stuff you never would have been willing to pay to develop(Linux), and sometimes a quality levels too high to be rational for the market to provide.

The worst part of free software is you get what you get, and the developers don't have to listen to you.

3. Spend more time doing things you never regret. Make your listâ€”then spend more time on it!

4. Writing cultures have this neat side effect of overcoming some drawbacks of hierarchy and org boundaries. Anyone in the company can write an insightful proposal for how something should be improved, and it will get noticed if it's compelling. Meetings can never scale like that.
