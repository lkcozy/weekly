Wind and solar generate over a tenth of the world's electricity. Taken together, they are the fourth-largest source of electricity, behind coal, gas, and hydro.

This infographic based on data from Ember shows the rise of electricity from these two clean sources over the last decade.

Authentic geothermal energy is truly green. This is where you get heat from the Earth's core, which some have calculated is hotter than the sun's surface.

3. [iPhone Lidar With Applications For The Geosciences](https://opentopography.org/blog/iphone-lidar-applications-geosciences)

Lidar (light detection and ranging) is a typical remote sensing technique used to create high-resolution three-dimensional models of landscapes and built features. Lidar uses laser pulses to measure distances to the ground or other features. Traditionally, lidar scanners are mounted to airborne or terrestrial platforms, but we now have the power of lidar in our own hands.

The built-in lidar scanners on the new iPhone and iPad Pros provide an easy, hand-held way to create 3D models of objects of interest rapidly. The 3D model combines lidar and photogrammetry (pictures taken from different object views to create a 3D reconstruction). The lidar provides a known scale, and the photos provide texture for the 3D models.

## AI/ML

1. [Recognizing Workplace Hazards](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-145/)

A wearable device may help warehouse workers avoid injuries.

**Why it matters**: AI might improve conventional industries' efficiency and humanity. This system's capacity to identify physical posture concerns allows for moment-to-moment ergonomic assessment. As a result, employers and employees benefit from workplace safety.

**How it works**: Belt-mounted gadget monitors the wearer's behaviour and surroundings.

- Six sensors monitor the user's posture, movement, location, noise, illumination, temperature, and air quality.
- Cloud-based machine learning algorithms score users.
- A high score triggers haptic feedback signalling a dangerous motion.
- The belts include RFID chips to track their positions.

1. [The Most Common Habits from more than 200 English Papers written by Graduate Chinese Engineering Students](https://papertalks.org/p/resources/Academic/EnglishWritingSkills/MostCommonEnglishWritingHabitsOfChinese.pdf)

This article shows some of the most common Chinese-English habits discovered in over 200 English technical publications written by Chinese writers.

The habits are described, and in most cases, example text from an actual work is provided with suggested text.

An attempt is made to illustrate how such errors might be corrected and avoided. In some cases, an explanation for why the habit happens is also provided.

This article can be used as an individual guide to editing technical papers when a native English-speaking editor is unavailable.

## Tool

1. [google-spreadsheet](google-spreadsheet)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/cpress/image/upload/w_1280,e_sharpen:60/zrezug7hiyv5p8aikjlp.jpg)

Google Sheets API (v4) wrapper for Node.js.

2. [capture-website](https://github.com/sindresorhus/capture-website)

A high-level Puppeteer wrapper makes it easy to capture screenshots of websites from Node or the command line.

3. [Regular Expression Tester and Visualizer](https://devtoolcafe.com/tools/regex#!flags=img&re=)

![](https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202205/bg2022051803.webp)

Regular Expression Tester and Visualizer is a free online developer tool to test and visualize a regular expression against any string instantly with matches highlighted, including a cheat sheet and reference.

4. [CortexJS](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/)

![](https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202203/bg2022033103.webp)

CortexJS is a web component for math input.

5. [SON Mask](https://github.com/nemtsov/json-mask)

```ts
var mask = require("json-mask");
mask({ p: { a: 1, b: 2 }, z: 1 }, "p/a,z"); // {p: {a: 1}, z: 1}
```

This is a tiny language and an engine for selecting specific parts of a JS object, hiding/masking the rest.

6. [nve](https://github.com/ehmicky/nve)

Unlike `nvm exec,` nve can run any command on specific Node.js versions at once.

George Mack shares his observations on where the world might shift due to COVID.

- the world is flat
  - The winners of remote work are skillful people in the developing world
  - The losers of remote work are unskilled people in the developed world
- declining assets. Office politics. Alcohol consumption. Middle management.
- inclining assets. Ability to self-teach. Written communications.
- Arbitrage advantage. Get high paid and live in a low-cost place.
- Digital neighbours> physical neighbours
- Cities start competing
- Migration-as-a-service
- First teenage self-made billionaire

3. [Why We've Ditched Scrum Sprints (And You Should Too)](https://medium.com/@michalikmartin/why-we've-ditched-scrum-sprints-and-you-should-too-cdf5678e5199)

The author shares some traps he saw with the Scrum sprits and why he decided to ditch the scrum sprits altogether.

Scrum, or any other process, is neither bad nor good if you know what you're aiming to achieve and focus on that. Then, Barrow the good parts and make the process fit your needs.

## Comments

1. `The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction. When in doubt, just remove. But be careful of what you remove. â€¦ When it is possible to reduce a system's functionality without significant penalty, true simplification is realized."
   --[The Laws of Simplicity](https://fs.blog/the-laws-of-simplicity/)

2. Trust is earned in drops and lost in buckets.
   --[FS](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-8-2022/)

3. We are conditioned to compare ourselves to whoever is doing best. That's the bar. An impossible standard that encourages us to take more and more risks.
   --[FS](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-8-2022/)

4. I strongly believe that all managers in a technical area must be technically excellent. Managers in software must write great software or it's like being a cavalry captain who can't ride a horse.
