1. [A Short Guide To The Chinese Coordinate System](https://abstractkitchen.com/blog/a-short-guide-to-chinese-coordinate-system/)

![](https://abstractkitchen.com/static/assets/coordinates.jpg)

Chinese regulators require approved map services to use standard GCJ-02. It was formulated by the Chinese State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping in 2002. Sometimes GCJ-02 is called Mars coordinates. GCJ-02 is based on WGS-84 and uses an obfuscation algorithm, adding random offsets to the latitude and longitude to improve national security. If the WGS-84 point is placed on the GCJ-02 map, on average, there will be a location offset for about 300-500m. Very few are into the ¬´miles¬ª apart, usually just by a couple of blocks.

2. [How Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain Revolutionize business](https://pupuweb.com/iot-ai-blockchain-revolutionize-business/)

In this paper, we'll explore how you can prepare your business for IoT, AI, and blockchain and empower your organization to exploit them now and in the future.

**IoT feels. And AI and machine learning think. Blockchain remembers.**

- IoT is like the human nervous system. With billions of connected devices worldwide, it senses, now recording a universe of new data.
- AI is like the reasoning part of your brain. It thinks by analyzing data and making decisions previously reversed for humans.
- Blockchain is like your memory - creating a secure, immutable record of transactions and data exchange.

IoT is transforming a world of things into a world of data.

1. [What Are Microservices Really All About?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTAcCNbJ7KE)

Microservices architecture enables large teams to build scalable applications composed of many loosely coupled services.

What does a typical microservices architecture look like? And when should we use it? Let's take a look.

## Resources

1. [Write Privately](https://weichenliu.xyz/write-privately/)

Writing privately means writing for yourself.

Why?

- Writing makes you a better thinker.
- By putting ideas into words, you challenge what you think you know.
- Day by day, you will understand the world more deeply.
- You'll realize what you don't know.
- You'll be more curious.

If you start writing for the public, external rewards can shift your priority. Instead of taking time to think better, you bother yourself with numbers that don't matter.

The more you write, the more curious you will be. Hold on to the curiosity. Find answers in books. And come back to write. Repeat the process. This is how you learn.

Writing privately gives you time and space to confront your anxiety, humiliation, uncertainty, and complexity. Remember, **you're not doing this to make yourself feel good. You're doing this to make yourself a better thinker**.

Notice what thoughts excite you - not those that sound smart, but those that interest you intrinsically. Curiosity will always be your drive.

## Comments

1. Focusing on the product trumps coding skills every time, not the least because sometimes not writing new code is the best decision for the product."
   --[How to Outperform a 10x Developer](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-outperform-a-10x-developer-fa1132807934)

2. Just a reminder that all bug prioritisation schemes in practice degenerate to three scheduling categories: do it now, do it later, never do it. If you have a numbered system with many priority levels, what you actually have is a bureaucratic system of denial.

3. Learning is necessary for our success and personal growth. But we can't maximize the time we spend learning because our feelings about what we 'should' be doing get in the way.

4. A common misconception about quitting is that it will slow your progress or stop it altogether. But it is the reverse that is actually true. If you stick to a path that is no longer worth pursuing, whether it's a relationship that isn't going well, or a stock that you're invested in that's losing money, or an employee that you've hired who isn't performing that is when you lose ground.
