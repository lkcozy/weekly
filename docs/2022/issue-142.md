The Spatial Web will enable us to build a twin of our physical reality in the virtual realm and bring the digital into our real environments.

The Spatial Web's strength stems from its ability to explain the world in the language of 'geometry,' the language in which the world communicates with us. It allows us to overlay online information geographically and contextually on items and places, allowing us to engage with data in the most natural and intuitive ways possible, such as by just looking, speaking, gesturing, or even thinking.

It also enables the digital to be more physical as sensors and robotics become embedded into our environments and onto the objects around us.

It makes our world smarter by adding intelligence and context to every place, thing, or person we come across. By decentralizing and dispersing data computation and storage, it makes our connections with each other and this new network more trustworthy, safe, and quicker.

The Spatial Web has the potential to move us from predominantly egocentric and ethnocentric concerns to more world-centric ones that are more holistic, equitable, and inclusive.

## Research

1. [Dissertation & Thesis Outline | Example & Free Templates](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/dissertation-thesis-outline/)

A thesis or dissertation outline is one of the most critical early steps in your writing process. It helps you lay out and organize your ideas and provides you with a roadmap for deciding what kind of research you'd like to undertake.

Generally, an outline contains information on the different sections included in your thesis or dissertation, such as:

- Your anticipated title
- Your abstract
- Your chapters (sometimes subdivided into further topics like literature review, research methods, avenues for future research, etc.)

## Comments

1. The Web3 thinking is based on the naive technocratic assumption that technology and "smart ideas" can solve most of our societal problems.
   --[Elon Musk is right. Web3 is BS.](https://maciekbaron.medium.com/elon-musk-is-right-web3-is-bs-1cdafc3f96f7)
2. You can't have real decentralization without a fair and just power distribution.
   --Ditto
3. Web3 will only shift power from the Big Tech to the VCs â€” not to the people.
   --Ditto
