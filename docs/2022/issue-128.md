## Resources

Zoid is an open-source cross-domain component toolkit created by a PayPal developer.

Zoid is geared around sharing functionality from one domain to another in a cross-domain iframe, with which you can't share native-javascript components.

This library can turn the application into the host of a plugin framework.

A plugin framework would allow creators to focus on the functionality they are trying to provide and free them from dealing with difficult-and-time-consuming tasks such as auth, login, configuration, etc.

2. It seems to me, that once a company reaches a tipping point of more than 50% non-engineers in upper management, it's the demise of the company as an engineering company, and it will slowly drift in the direction of being a technology holding company only.
