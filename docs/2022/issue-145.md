## GeoSpatial

1. [The Spatial Web and Web 3.0](https://www.immersivelearning.news/2020/08/14/the-spatial-web-and-web-3-0/)

In this article, the author defines the vision for the Spatial Web, discusses the technology it is built upon and describes the path to maturity.

The Spatial Web will enable us to build a twin of our physical reality in the virtual realm and bring the digital into our real environments.

This vision will be realized through the growth and convergence of enabling technologies:

- Spatial computing: augmented and virtual reality
- Physical computing: IoT and robotic sensors
- Decentralized computing: blockchain, which enables great security and data authentication
- Edge computing: pushes compute power to where it's most needed, speeding everything up.

The figure below shows how key enabling technologies drive their respective computing eras.

- Interaction: AR/VR devices are expected to be a primary gateway for humans to access the Spatial Web.
- Computation: AI/ML will play a foundation role in Spatial Web computation, which enables machines and devices to understand the non-digital world.
- Information: Distributed ledger technologies will be foundational due to the proliferation of data and associated security concerns.

2. [Tracking Changes on Earth's Surface](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-152/)

Computer vision systems are scanning satellite photos to track construction on the Earth's surface — an exercise in behaviour recognition on a global scale.

Photos taken from orbit are a vital resource for intelligence agencies.

It's impractical for human analysts to comb the flood of images from more than 150 satellites that observe Earth from orbit. Machine learning opens huge opportunities beyond Smart's focus on national security by automating the process.

Large-scale events on Earth are of interest to all of the planet's inhabitants.

3. [Sentinel Hub](https://mapscaping.com/podcast/sentinel-hub/)

![](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/img/wrapper-img.png)

Sentinel Hub makes satellite data easily accessible for you to be browsed or analyzed within your environment.

Imagine something between The Microsoft Planetry Computer and Google Earth Engine, and you probably think about Sentinel Hub!

## Research

1. [Last minute proofing 12 things to look for](https://patthomson.net/2022/06/27/last-minute-proofing-12-things-to-look-for/)

Proofing. There are often last-minute proofing – formatting and consistency – checks. Here's a little list of proofing issues that need a last-minute look.

- References: follow a particular referencing style
- Spelling
- Abbreviations: e.g., etc.
- Fonts
- Numbering figures and sections
- Linking
- Quotation marks
- Spaces
- Commas
- List
- Stops
- Numbers
- Dates

## Tool

1. [TanStack Table](https://github.com/tanstack/table)

![](https://github.com/tanstack/table/raw/main/media/repo-header.png)

Formerly known as React Table, TanStack Table was released with additional support for Solid.js, Vue, and Svelte. It's headless, 100% TypeScript, and features a faster and simpler API.

2. [string-strip-html](https://github.com/codsen/codsen/tree/main/packages/string-strip-html)

Strips HTML tags from strings. No parser accepts diverse sources. You can strip HTML and contents, keep the contents, and even tackle widow words.

3. [linkinator](https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/linkinator)

Both a Node.js API and CLI tool can be used to crawl a site and validate links. You can run it as quickly as npx linkinator https://example.com/ right now if you want to try it out.

4. [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)

Zod is the TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.

## Resources

1. [Remote First, Async Second](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-first-async-second-dror-poleg/)

Creative work takes time, but more time does not necessarily equal a more valuable output. The best ideas come up when intelligent people are allowed to focus — on their own or with a small group.

The shape of the future of work will be quite different. People will have more flexibility in choosing where, when, and how to work.

2. The Skill/Experience vs. Outcomes "Curves" Look Different

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVt7KQNVsAASc6w?format=jpg&name=small)

A nurturing environment can achieve "good" outcomes with "average" people.

In an unhealthy environment, only the most skilled can achieve outcomes...and even then, there's a limiter.

3. [Why Most Strategies Lack Clarity](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-27b52-why-most-strategies-lack)

The lack of clarity and coherence is a natural outgrowth of fear—fear of being seen as less capable, limiting optionality, being wrong, and making informed guesses.

Strategy, like planning, has merit by helping us prioritize and make decisions. It doesn't mean these are the right ones. They are only right within the constraints and context we have now.

## Comments

1. Many have discovered an argument hack. They don't need to argue that something is false. They just need to show that it's associated with low status. The converse is also true: You don't need to argue that something is true. You just need to show that it's associated with high status. And when low status people express the truth, it sometimes becomes high status to lie.

2. Developers sticking to what they know and staying in their comfort zone will lead to developer fatigue and boredom. To evolve as a developer, you need to combine different approaches, technologies, best practices and create something new.

3. Cynicism makes you look smart and is discouraging for others. Optimism makes you look stupid and is encouraging for others.

4. City as a classroom. Big cities are the ideal size for learning. They're big enough to cater to a diversity of interests but small enough to be understandable. Each one has a distinct feel.
