The paper examines the current state of knowledge, focusing on the second-order impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through a geospatial lens.

The second-order impacts of COVID-19 are seasonal, spatial, and scalar across multiple thematic areas, including the economy, environmental health, education, and mobility.

The results show that governments could apply geospatial data and methodologies to developing mitigation strategies to prioritize limited resources to minimize the long-term consequences of COVID-19.

First-order impacts (number of COVID-19 cases) lead to the second-order effects.

Machines are doing light janitorial work in the uncontrolled environment of Google's offices.

**Why it matters**: Robotics could take care of older people in many countries or people who cannot do it themselves.

But many people's jobs are being threatened. So it's essential to provide workers with retraining, re-skilling, and safety nets to ensure no one is left behind.

1. [What Is Engineering Enablement](https://softwareleadweekly.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1a258e0fefbb23214c59c5a8d&id=9d95ea8c04&e=b1367de9f9)

Once you cross the 30 engineers, it feels like the right time to consider the Engineering Enablement.

Engineering Enablement can be

- a guild.
- a squad or a task force made up of different individual contributors who have been tasked with solving a specific issue.
- a formal team and role in the organization.

Engineering Enablement teams should be viewed as a stand-alone product (feature) team that is serving customers (other developers/stakeholders) within the organization."

First, you have to understand why they aren't meeting your expectations.

There are only three reasons why.

- They don't know your `expectations`.
- They don't have the right `skills`.
- They don't have the `motivation`.

If someone doesn't know your expectations, then it's on you.

- Have you been clear about what you expect?
- Have you given them a chance to weigh in on whether the expectations are reasonable?
- Have you explained why the expectations are what they are?

If someone doesn't have the skills to meet your expectations

- Can you acknowledge you hired poorly?
- Can you train them in what their current role needs?
- Can you help them transition to a role that is a better fit for their strength?

If someone isn't motivated to meet your expectations

> This one often takes more time to get to the bottom of.

- There are more important things going on in their non-work life
- Your values and theirs diff
- They don't feel their work matters
- The mission doesn't inspire them
- They aren't learning or growing
- They don't feel respected

In some cases, the best thing to do is to recognize there is a mismatch in what the person wants and what you want, and part ways.

In other cases, working on the relationship through better communication can resolve the motivation issue.

## Comments

1. Make one person responsible. If you want to get something done, it's tempting to put a huge number of people in charge. But often, when too many people are in charge, nobody accepts responsibility. This saying is illustrative: "A dog with two owners dies of hunger."
   --[David Perell](https://ckarchive.com/b/zlughnhz932k)

2. When you first start a company, you need Swiss Army Knife people who can do a little bit of everything. Once your company gets big, you need a bunch of kitchen knife people who do one thing very, very well.

3. In theory, we know how to behave. But in practice, we don't always do it. The Ancient Greeks called this phenomenon "akrasia", which translates to "weakness of will". It describes our tragic proclivity to act against our best interests, even when we know what to do.
