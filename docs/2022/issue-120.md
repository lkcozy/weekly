1. [How is the Third Law of Geography different?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19475683.2022.2026467?af=R)

![](https://www.tandfonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/tandf/journals/content/tagi20/0/tagi20.ahead-of-print/19475683.2022.2026467/20220111/images/medium/tagi_a_2026467_f0001_oc.jpg)

The first law: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things, which focuses on `spatial proximity.

The second law: The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside, which focuses on the `spatial heterogeneity of geographic phenomena`.

The third law: The more similar geographic configurations of two points(areas), the more similar the values(processes) of the target variable at these two points (areas), which concerns `geographic similarity.

The differences of it from the first two can be perceived in three basic aspects: `principle expressed,form of expression,role` of geographic samples.

The third law is an important addition to the other two and provides a potentially transformative way to address the rigid requirements on samples in geographic analysis.

## AI/ML

1. [Stopping Guns at the Gate](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-127/)

![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/HEXWAVE.gif?upscale=true&width=1200&upscale=true&name=HEXWAVE.gif)

A Major League Baseball stadium will be using computer vision to detect weapons as fans enter.

**Why it matters**: Traditional security checkpoints can be slow, intrusive, and ineffective. AI stands to make them more effective and much more efficient.

**How it works**: The system scans passing bodies and alerts guards to potential threats even if they're concealed by clothing or luggage. It can scan 1,000 people per hour.

- The system scans visitors with microwaves, which penetrate various materials and constructs a 3D image of the body in real-time.
- A machine learning model interprets the imagery.

After being truly educated, you know what you have stored in your mind to know where to look, how to look, how to question, how to challenge, how to proceed independently to deal with the challenges that the world presents to you and that you develop in the course of yourself education and inquiry and investigations in cooperation and solidarity with others.

1. [Software Architecture Patterns](https://orkhanscience.medium.com/software-architecture-patterns-5-mins-read-e9e3c8eb47d2)

First of all, if you know the basics of architecture patterns, it is easier for you to follow the requirements of your architect.

There are five common software architecture patterns:

- Layered
  - ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*A7O_q3LjFeMoyZUJ.png)
  - the most common architecture for monolithic applications.
  - divide the app logic into several layers, each encapsulating a specific role.
- Event-driven
  - ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*S5x3if-_wD4nyeIB.png)
  - decouple the application into single-purpose event processing components that asynchronously receive and process events
  - high scalability and adaptability
- Microkernel or Plugin
  - ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*gtpsajLc78449AwB.png)
  - a core system and plug-in modules or extensions
- Microservices
  - ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*ZTArqwaUeQyjrvfn.png)
  - consists of separately deployed services
  - each service would have ideally single responsibility
  - Those services are independent of each other
- Space-based or Cloud
  - ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*Q0VJyMBJX5OHpE_k.png)
  - distributed shared memory to mitigate issues that frequently occur at the database level
  - by processing most of the operations using in-memory data, we can avoid extra operations in the database
  - the basic approach is to separate the application into processing units
  - processing units can automatically scale up and down based on demand
  - data will be replicated and processed between those units without any persistence to the central database

1. When you see other people succeed, use it as inspiration. Extract energy from other people who do well.

4. A leader should not be passive. A leader who is reactive or fatalistic will have a hard time being great at their role. If a leader is not committed to constant improvement, it can be very hard for those in less-senior roles to make changes happen in their stead.
