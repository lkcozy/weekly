## GeoSpatial

1. [Quantitative spatiotemporal impact of dynamic population density changes on the COVID-19 pandemic in China's mainland](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10095020.2022.2066576?af=R)

This is the first quantitative assessment of the impacts of dynamic population density on the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the population density increase daily by one person/km2 in a county with an average size of 26,000km2, the county would have an additional 3.6 confirmed cases and 0.054 death cases after five days.

Estimating human dynamic spatiotemporal distribution can help us understand how to mitigate COVID-19 spread, which can help maintain urban heath within a county and between countries within a country.

2. [The World's Population Density by Latitude](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/mapped-the-worlds-population-density-by-latitude/)

This world map depicts population density by latitude, going from the densest populated coordinates deep red to the sparsest in light blue.

We see the population becoming more concentrated near the equator. In particular, **the 25th and 26th parallels north are the most densely populated latitude circles**. **Around 279 million people** reside in these latitude lines, which run through large countries like China, the United States, Indian and others.

## Research

1. [What Is Critical Thinking?](https://www.scribbr.com/working-with-sources/critical-thinking/)

Critical thinking is the ability to analyze information and form a judgement effectively.

To think critically, you must be aware of your biases and assumptions when encountering information and apply consistent standards when evaluating sources.

In an academic context, critical thinking can help you to determine whether a source:

- Is free from research bias
- Provides evidence to support its findings
- Considers alternative viewpoints

Critical thinking skills help you to

- Identify credible sources
- Evaluate and respond to arguments
- Assess alternative viewpoints
- Test hypotheses against relevant criteria

When encountering information, ask:

- Who is the author? Are they an expert in their field?
- What do they say? Is their argument clear? Can you summarize it?
- When did they say this? Is the source current?
- Where is the information published? Is it an academic article? Is it a blog? A newspaper article?
- Why did the author publish it? What is their motivation?
- How do they make their argument? Does evidence back it up? Does it rely on opinion, speculation, or appeals to emotion? Do they address alternative arguments?

When you make an argument or draw your conclusions, you can ask questions about your writing:

- Am I only considering evidence that supports my preconceptions?
- Is my argument expressed clearly and backed up with credible sources?
- Would I be convinced by this argument coming from someone else?

"Good bosses don't let chronic underperformers stay in the role. They change the role or help the employee find their next thing. Bad bosses blame struggling employees and hope they improve." -- Michael Girdley shares many gems. Some might feel trivial, but having 20 years in the industry, very few managers follow these insights.

2. [What Are Wrapped Cryptocurrencies?](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/wrapped-bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-wbtc-tbtc-wnxm-hbtc-crypto)

Interoperability, or the ability of different blockchain protocols to interact and exchange value with one other, has long been a priority in the cryptocurrency space.

Wrapped cryptocurrencies present one solution to DeFi-related interoperability challenges.

In short, they allow crypto assets to be used on non-native blockchains. For example, bitcoin, in its wrapped form, can be used to interact with Ethereum's ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps).

## Comments

1. The Persuasion Paradox. Have you noticed that argumentative people rarely persuade anyone of anything? Persuasive people don't argue-they observe, listen, and ask questions. Argue less, persuade more. Persuasion is an art that requires a paintbrush, not a sledgehammer.

2. A life spent looking for shortcuts is a long road to nowhere.

3. Deprecate yourself. Don't be the go-to person for the code. Optimize it for people to find their way fixing bugs and adding features to the code. Free yourself to move on to the next project/company. Don't own the code or you'll never grow beyond that.

4. Private blockchains are entirely useless. If you already have a permissioned system, there is not point in using a trustless and permission less database.
