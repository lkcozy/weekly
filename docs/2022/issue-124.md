2. [A Look at 3 Trends Shaping Remote Sensing in the Next 5 Years](https://www.gislounge.com/a-look-at-3-trends-shaping-remote-sensing-in-the-next-5-years/)

Remote sensing is going mainstream, both in the business and personal worlds, and has the potential to lead us into the metaverse. Here's a look at three trends that will reshape the use of remote sensing over the next five years:

- The worlds of IoT and remote sensing will collide
  - Sensors are becoming less expensive and smaller
  - Use of 5G and satellite internet will improve our ability to transfer data from millions of devices to cloud computing environments, where it can be digested and analyzed to gain more meaningful insights.
  - Combining the traditional IoT device's operational information and remote sensing environmental data effectively will provide us with a holistic picture of how a device operates and what is happening in its environment at that time.
- Crowdsourced data collection will become more sophisticated
  - A lot of our personal data is being crowdsourced today
- The metaverse is coming, and geospatial will matter
  - Real estate is the next metaverse frontier

## Comments

1. Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.
   --[Kevin Kelly](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)

2. Don't be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.

3. The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man .
