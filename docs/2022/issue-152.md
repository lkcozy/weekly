2. [Geographic information science in the era of big geospatial data: A cyberspace perspective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675822000753?fr=RR-9&rr=740166f15dffc719)

![The conceptual view of GIScience from the perspectives of geospatial big data and cyberspace](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2666675822000753-gr1.jpg)

This commentary introduces a brief narrative review and a framework for the cyber thinking and analysis of challenges and opportunities for GIScience with a specific focus on emerging geospatial big data.

As shown in the above figure, interactions among people, environments, and sensors play a crucial role in emerging geographic and cyberspaces.

Taking these interactions into account, this commentary examines the current research agenda on data contents, data modelling, and data analysis, as we highlight and discuss opportunities and challenges.

3. [Earth FM](https://earth.fm/)

Earth.fm is an online community that listens to natural sounds from across the globe. Recordists from around the world captured nature's sounds and uploaded them to a website. It was shown on the map. You may zoom in and listen to the sound. If you are relatively quiet around or listen with headphones, you will feel as if you are in nature.

## AI/ML

1. [One Cool Robot](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-159/)

Autonomous robots are restocking refrigerated sections in corner stores. FamilyMart, a chain of Japanese convenience stores, plans to employ robots to fill shelves with beverage bottles at 300 locations.

**Why it matters**: Japan faces an aging workforce with no end. People over 65 make up around a quarter of the population, which is expected to have the world's highest average age for decades.

**How it works**: The robot includes an arm and camera. It shuttles along a rail between stock shelves and the rear of a customer-facing refrigerator, moving up to 1,000 containers a day.

From making french fries to restocking shelves, the jobs that once were rites of passage for young adults are increasingly automated.

## Research

1. [How to Write a Discussion Section](https://www.scribbr.com/research-paper/discussion/)

The discussion section is where you delve into your results' meaning, importance, and relevance.

It should focus on explaining and evaluating what you found, showing how it relates to your literature review, and making an argument supporting your overall conclusion. It should not be a second results section.

Steps to write the section

- **Summarize your key findings**: a brief recap of your key results
- **Give your interpretations**: what do your results mean?
- **Discuss the implications**: why do your results matter?
- **Acknowledge the limitations**: what can't your results tell us?
- **Share your recommendations**: avenues for further studies or analyses

What not to include in your discussion section?

- **Don't introduce new results**: you should only discuss the data you have already reported in your results section.
- **Don't make inflated claims**: avoid over-interpretation and speculation that isn't directly supported by your data.
- **Don't undermine your research**: the discussion of limitations should aim to strengthen your credibility, not emphasize weaknesses of failures.

2. [How to Write a Thesis Conclusion](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/write-conclusion/)

The conclusion is the very last part of your thesis or dissertation. The conclusion should be `concise and engaging`. Aim to leave the reader with a clear understanding of the major discovery of argument that your research has advanced.

Steps to write the section:

- Clearly state the answer to your primary research question
- Summarize the overall argument or key takeaways
- Reflect any important limitations of the research
- Show what new knowledge you have contributed
- Make recommendations for future work on this topic
- Not introduce any new data, interpretations, or arguments

3. [What Is a Proper Noun](https://www.scribbr.com/nouns-and-pronouns/proper-nouns/)

A proper noun is a noun that serves as the name for a specific place, person, or thing.

- **Proper nouns** name specific people, things, and places. They are always capitalized.
- **Common nouns** are more generalâ€”they name generic types of people, things, and places. They usually are only capitalized at the start of a sentence.

![](https://fourminutebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-daily-stoic-summary-768x384.jpg)

The book addresses the natural thinking process of humans by pointing out areas of improvement that we can work on through a fresher perspective, acts of change, and the power of will.

The core principles of stoicism:

- Perception gives course to your thoughts, actions, and ultimately everything you do.
- We can change the course of our life by actively managing our actions and responses.
- Will is the internal power we as humans possess and use to nurture hope.

This is an excellent thread on how to have a compelling point of view without speaking in annoying absolutes.

1. If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.
   --[Leslie Lamport](https://fs.blog/brain-food/august-21-2022/)

2. History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among people themselves.
   --[Jared Diamond](https://fourminutebooks.com/guns-germs-and-steel-summary/)

3. When I was younger, I was really put off by the idea of having to provide estimates for tasks that I'd never done before. Now I realize that the manager really just needs to put a number into their schedule so they have something to take back to the bean counters, and a number coming from me is going to be at least slightly more accurate than one they pull completely out of the air by themselves.
