1. [Decentralized Applications Architecture: Back End, Security and Design Patterns](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-design-a-secure-backend-for-your-decentralized-application-9541b5d8bddb/)

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*sd62aH6GGS1RoCR9t4QNyQ.png)

In this article, the author covered several main principles of properly designing and implementing back-end and smart contracts for decentralized applications.

Decentralized applications, or ÐApps, require a unique system design to achieve high security and reliability.

The primary value of blockchain and other similar technologies is that they allow people to **write and run programs which cannot be changed after creation nor tampered with during execution**.

An example flow of the server's reaction to the user's action in the decentralized network.

2. [How to Use Web3.js to Interact With the Ethereum Virtual Machine in Remix](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-web3-js-to-interact-with-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-in-remix-f4923b18e707)

This article explored the evolution of Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, Web3, and working with web3.js.

web3.js is a collection of JavaScript libraries to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.

- Web 1.0: read
- Web 2.0: read + write
- Web 3.0: read + write + own

> A blockchain is a public database that is updated and shared across many computers in a network

> Block refers to data and state being stored in consecutive groups.

> Chain refers to that each block cryptographically references its parent. i.e., blocks get chained together.

> Smart contracts are apps and services which are executed automatically.

3. Enough is elusive because when you reach it, you're no longer the person that once desired it. Once you occupy an entirely new world, that prior version of yourself is largely inaccessible.
