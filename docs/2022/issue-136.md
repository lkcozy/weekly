GlobalFungi, a global database of fungal occurrences from high-throughput-sequencing metabarcoding studies.

Fungi can be essential conduits for nutrients in soils. They have even been called the 'circulatory system' of the Earth because of the nutrients they move around, particularly in areas with often poor soils.

Around the world, several scientists are looking to create "contagious vaccines" that would spread by themselves, giving herd immunity to populations faster than the disease can spread itself.

If the technique proves to be successful and without harm, maybe the next potential pandemic could be one we never end up hearing about.

## Comments

1. Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two.
   --[Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/)

2. Productivity is often a distraction. Don't aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible. Rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.
   --Ditto

3. The consistency of your endeavours (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally..
   --Ditto

4. Ask anyone you admire: Their lucky breaks happened on a detour from their main goal. So embrace detours. Life is not a straight line for anyone.
   --Ditto
