## GeoSpatial

1. [Training Data for GIS Applications of Machine Learning](https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/training-data-for-gis-applications-of-machine-learning/)

Geospatial intelligence provides geographical information and distribution of elements in geographic space and is now an essential tool for everything, from national security to land use and planning to agriculture and a host of commercial and government functions.

2. [GeoParquet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet)

GeoParquet is a specification for storing geospatial vector data (point, line, polygon) in Parquet.

The goal is to standardize how geospatial data is represented in Parquet to further interoperability among tools using Parquet today and hopefully help push forward what's possible with 'cloud-native geospatial' workflows.

[Parquet](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format) is a columnar storage format that supports nested data. See this [vendor explanation](https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet) for more on what that means

## Research

1. [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/)

![](https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202108/bg2021082404.jpg)

DOAJ is a community-curated online directory that indexes and provides access to high-quality, open access, peer-reviewed journals.

## Tool

1. [JSON Visio](https://github.com/AykutSarac/jsonvisio.com)

![](https://github.com/AykutSarac/jsonvisio.com/raw/main/public/preview_2.png)

JSON Visio is a data visualization tool for your json data that seamlessly illustrates your data on graphs without restructuring anything, pasting directly, or importing a file.

2. [fast-json-stringify](https://github.com/fastify/fast-json-stringify)

fast-json-stringify is significantly faster than JSON.stringify() for small payloads. Its performance advantage shrinks as your payload grows.

## Resources

1. [How to Find Great Developers By Having Them Read Code](https://freakingrectangle.com/2022/04/15/how-to-freaking-hire-great-developers/)

So instead of writing code, consider having the candidate read existing code and talk about what it does and how it works. This offers some decisive advantages:

- Reading probes the most fundamental skills
- Reading code is way more efficient than writing
- Reading puts candidates at ease compared to writing code

How do you develop such skills?

- Writes lots of code
- Do some non-trivial side project

2. [The 40% Rule for SAAS companies](https://avc.com/2015/02/the-40-rule/)

Here's the 40% rule, and it is aimed at SAAS companies:

**Your annual revenue growth rate + your operating margin should equal 40%**

- if you are growing 100% year over year, you can lose money at a rate of 60% of your revenues
- If you are growing 40% year over year, you should be breaking even
- If you are growing 20% year over year, you should have 20% operating margins
- If you are not growing, you should have 40% operating margins
- If your business is declining 10% year over year, you should have 50% operating margins

3. [Writing for Engineers](https://www.heinrichhartmann.com/posts/writing/)

Writing is thinking. Nurturing a culture where writing is appreciated can help you scale the company. It can help convey an idea and iterate on it with a few people until it's solid.

4. [JavaScript testing tutorial](https://wanago.io/courses/javascript-testing-tutorial/)

A detailed description of various JavaScript tests.

5. [Efficiency: Managing Infrastructure Costs](https://infraeng.dev/efficiency/)

This post will guide you to look at and optimize your costs. Make sure you have one experienced engineer owning this effort if you don't have a team (or don't need it yet).

## Comments

1. Learning how to think means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.

2. When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don't. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field.
   --[John Reed](https://fs.blog/brain-food/april-17-2022/)

3. Today, not tomorrow.

What you avoid today is harder to do tomorrow.

Today's choices become tomorrow's position. If you put off things today, they don't magically disappear tomorrow. They just get added to the list of things you want to do.

Don't wait till tomorrow. Tomorrow is where dreams go to die.

4. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to lve what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
