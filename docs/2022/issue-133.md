The European Union approved an AI system that recognizes regular chest X-rays for clinical use.

**Why it matters**: Reading X-ray images is highly subjective. Moreover, a radiologist's judgment can vary as fatigue sets in over a working day. This system could help radiologists focus on the cases needing the most attention by identifying and reporting standard images.

4. [Motivating Developers to Care About Documentation](https://getdx.com/best-practices/documentation-culture-engineering)

Treat documentation like a discipline. As much as you incentivize shipping code, you need to incentivize good documentation. Set a culture that promotes documentation to:

- making better decisions across the organization
- helping people get the correct information when they need it
- making our onboarding process more self-service(my opinion is that onboarding should be 80% self-serve)

## Comments

1. As I've progressed through my career, I've experienced increasing imposter syndrome: you feel like you are not qualified to do your job.

2. Your real friends are the ones who are there for you when it's none of thoseâ€”when you have _nothing_ to offer in return.

3. Software engineering: 50% understanding requirements, 40% complexity management, 9% debugging, 1% solving "interesting" algorithmic problems. You'll enjoy software engineering a whole lot more if you instead think of the first 99% as the interesting part.
