## GeoSpatial

1. [Elements of a Map](https://www.gislounge.com/whats-in-a-map/)

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_810+q_glossy+ret_img+to_webp/https://www.gislounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/parts-of-map-united-states.png)

Maps are the primary tools by which spatial relationships and geographic data are visualized. Maps, therefore, become essential documents.

These eight possible map elements that make up the parts of a map are:

- data (or map) frame
- map legend
- map title
- north arrow
- map scale bar
- metadata (or map citation)
- border (or neatline)
- inset (or locator) map.

This map shows you how far you can travel from each station in Europe in less than 5 hours.

3. [Types of GIS Data Explored: Vector and Raster](https://www.gislounge.com/geodatabases-explored-vector-and-raster-data/)

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_600+q_glossy+ret_img+to_webp/https://www.gislounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vector-raster-comparison.png)

GIS data can be separated into two categories: **spatially referenced data**, which is represented by **vector** and **raster** forms (including imagery) and **attribute tables**, which are represented in tabular format.

## AI/ML

1. [Auto Diagnosis](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/military-ai-spending-grows-automated-talent-scout-drive-thru-car-inspection-humanized-training-for-robots/)

![](https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/07/UVEYE.gif)

A drive-through system inspects vehicles for dents, leaks, and low tire pressure.

**Why it matters**: A computer vision system that completes inspections in seconds can free mechanics to focus on more critical tasks, help dealers evaluate trade-ins, and give customers confidence that service stations are addressing real issues.

Autonomous driving is the first automotive application for AI that many people think of, but other essential tasks are easier to automate. Streamlining routine maintenance is one.

## Tool

## Resources

1. [How to Present to Executives](https://lethain.com/present-to-executives/)

![](https://cdn.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/assets/scqa-1024x436.png)

Will Larson covers excellent tips to learn and practice when presenting to executives in your company. The `SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)` method can be practiced to pitch your ideas also to your peers.

This point is important to remember:" `A great meeting with executive leadership is defined by engaged discussion, not addressing every topic on the agenda.

Some will consider this a controversial position, preferring to measure every meeting by its action items, but this ignores the often more valuable `relationship establishment` and `development aspects` of these meetings."

> Situation: What is the context of what is happening? the stable state of the world
> Complication: Why is the writing needed? The change in the stable situation.
> Question: What needs to be solved? The question that is raised by the complication.
> Answer: The process of answering the question raised.

2. [The Practical Application of "Rocks, Pebbles, Sand"](https://longform.asmartbear.com/docs/rocks-pebbles-sand/)

![If you schedule the big things first, then you can fill in with smaller things.](https://longform.asmartbear.com/docs/rocks-pebbles-sand/_hu6352961a4222c5e7bb6537391ce7dcfa_309086_b70ef2ee8d3923040550ccd2b8519c5b.webp)

Schedule big things first. Otherwise, you run out of time. A thousand quick wins do not add up to creating durable advantages or fulfilling a long-term vision. Plan your next year's goals, and then to execute the day to day.

If you schedule little things first, you run out of time for the big things.

3. [I think the term "technical debt" is muddying the waters. Let us speak plainly](https://twitter.com/jamesshore/status/1550907737369784320)

To prevent this, follow the campsite rule: Always leave the code better than you found. To fix itâ€¦ follow the campsite rule. You don't need to ask permission for a week of refactoring or a rewrite. Just start tidying as you go.

4. [Simple tips for removing ambiguity](https://www.codingvc.com/p/spell-it-out?triedSigningIn=true)

Whether you're writing an article, creating a pitch deck, or crafting your resume, you should leave as little as possible to chance. If you suspect there's an ambiguity, eliminate it.

- The title of each slide in your deck should be the key takeaway.
- For each slide, ask yourself the worst possible interpretation.
- Ask 5+ people to write down their takeaways and gut reactions to each of your slides. Identify anything that seems unclear and fix it.

## Comments

1. Accept failure as an inevitable part of life: everything worth doing is worth doing poorly, in the sense that it's better to do something poorly than not doing it at all

2. Most of the programmers I look up to and learned from share one trait that is rarely talked about: fearlessness. They dive into an unknown codebase without fear. They start working on something without knowing how they'll finish. Becoming fearless yourself is one of the best learning accelerators I've found.
