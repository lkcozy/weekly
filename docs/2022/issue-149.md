Map projections allow us to convert from sphere to planar (flat) representation.

Geographic coordinate systems allow for the measurements of distances and determining direction. Geographic coordinates are expressed as a position either north or south of the Equator and east or west of the Prime Meridian.

The universal transverse Mercator (UTM) is a geographic coordinate system and the most prevalent plane grid system used.

## Comments

1. Consistency isn't simply willpower, which comes and goes. Consistency is doing it when you don't feel like doing it.
   --[Consistency](https://fs.blog/brain-food/july-31-2022/)

2. People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. But most people don't even try and just accept that things are the way that they are.
   --[How To Be Successful](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)

3. Nothing really matters, except bringing value to the customer. Type safety, 100% test coverage, the ability to fluently express business logic in code, perfect development tooling, an efficient system that wastes no resources, using the best programming language for the job, an elegant API design, a fast feedback loop, writing great code â€“ these are not the goal.

4. A large part of wisdom is knowing what to ignore. A large part of expertise is knowing where to place your attention.
