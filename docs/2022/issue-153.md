1. [What Distinguishes Great Software Engineers?](https://abinoda.substack.com/p/great-engineers)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa811c8c-83a4-4147-bf5d-6bfa7b4a4c92_1704x2300.png)

Numerous recent studies have led to an understanding that personality traits, technical abilities, and interpersonal skills collectively distinguish great engineers.

The top five attributes of great engineers:

- Being a competent coder. Paying attention to details, mentally capable of handling complexity.
- Maximizing the current value of their work. Anticipating future needs avoids analysis paralysis and is intentional about trade-offs. Great engineers distinguish themselves from others by considering the context of their software product, maximizing the value of their current actions, adjusted for probable future value and costs.
- Practicing informed decision-making. Gathering information to make informed decisions, data-driven, open-minded. Great engineers differentiated themselves from others by going through the right processes for making informed decisions.
- Enabling others to make decisions efficiently. Create shared understanding with others, and create shared success. Great engineers distinguished themselves by making others' jobs easier, helping them to make their decisions more efficiently (or, at minimum, they did not make them worse).
- Continuous learning. Desire, ability, and capacity to learn or figure out how something works. It's not a specific set of knowledge but rather the desire, ability, and capacity to learn that distinguishes great engineers.

2. [First rule of the team: size](https://medium.com/@kolyaskink/first-rule-of-the-team-size-94cdad8bc79e)

A good read for new manager-of-managers considering the org structure they want to form. Thinking of the parameters you'd look at when considering the team size.

Having 5 to 7 engineers per team is ideal. There are several arguments to justify that:

- Reasonable span of control for an Engineering Manager. The manager has enough time to host regular 1â€“1 dialogues, prepare for them(!), act on discussed points, etc.
- Feeling of camaraderie and bonding within the team. The average person feels safe and intimate within a group of around seven people.
- Resilience vs agility balance. On the one hand, team performance is not impacted by sick leaves, vacations, or personal days. On the other hand, all rituals (planning, retrospectives, etc.) can be done quickly and efficiently.

## Comments

1. Regardless of whether the future of work is office or remote, I certainly hope that the future of work is deep.

3. Most friends aren't friends. They're acquaintances. Friends phone you out-of-the-blue because they want to hear your voice. Friends would drive you to the emergency room at 3am. Friends are the family you choose, and they're key to happiness in old age. Invest in good people.
