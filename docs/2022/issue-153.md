These Best Practices do not seek to govern the use of UML within the OGC. However, the practices aim to provide guidance to assist in adherence to the following principles:

- Correctness — Adherence to the Object Management Group (OMG) UML standard.
- Consistency — UML artifacts should be consistent across OGC Standards and supporting standards such as those specified by ISO/TC 211.
- FAIRness — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable models.
- Value — Any modelling done, UML or otherwise, should add value to the parent standard.

Numerous recent studies have led to an understanding that personality traits, technical abilities, and interpersonal skills collectively distinguish great engineers.

The top five attributes of great engineers:

- Being a competent coder. Paying attention to details, mentally capable of handling complexity.
- Maximizing the current value of their work. Anticipating future needs avoids analysis paralysis and is intentional about trade-offs.
- Practicing informed decision-making. Gathering information to make informed decisions, data-driven, open-minded.
- Enabling others to make decisions efficiently. Create shared understanding with others, and create shared success.
- Continuous learning. Desire, ability, and capacity to learn or figure out how something works.

2. [First rule of the team: size](https://medium.com/@kolyaskink/first-rule-of-the-team-size-94cdad8bc79e)

A good read for new manager-of-managers considering the org structure they want to form. Thinking of the parameters you'd look at when considering the team size.

Having 5 to 7 engineers per team is ideal. There are several arguments to justify that:

- Reasonable span of control for an Engineering Manager. The manager has enough time to host regular 1–1 dialogues, prepare for them(!), act on discussed points, etc.
- Feeling of camaraderie and bonding within the team. The average person feels safe and intimate within a group of around seven people.
- Resilience vs agility balance. On the one hand, team performance is not impacted by sick leaves, vacations, or personal days. On the other hand, all rituals (planning, retrospectives, etc.) can be done quickly and efficiently.

3. [Focus to Win](https://fs.blog/focus-to-win/)

Anyone can say no to bad ideas, but only a focused person can say no to good ideas. Focus is about saying no.

Focus isn't a light switch you can turn on and off whenever you want to. It's something you have to practice every day.

Focus is hard, and because it's hard, it also creates a hidden place to find opportunities.

## Comments

1. Regardless of whether the future of work is office or remote, I certainly hope that the future of work is deep.
   --[Do We Need an Office?](https://zhuk.fi/do-we-need-an-office/)

2. Progress is measured in mistakes learned from.
   --[@shl](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1555542461316927488)

3. Most friends aren't friends. They're acquaintances. Friends phone you out-of-the-blue because they want to hear your voice. Friends would drive you to the emergency room at 3am. Friends are the family you choose, and they're key to happiness in old age. Invest in good people.
   --[@Julian](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1561745016569167874)

4. The new engineering mantra should be: (1) Make it work (2) Make it safe (3) Make it fast. Security/Robustness needs to come earlier in the engineering conversation, and once you've sorted out performance as well, you've done 80% of what you need to "make it right".
   --[@Julian](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1561745016569167874)

5. Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.

6. A doctor once told me the biggest thing they don't teach in medical school is the difference between medicine and being a doctor — medicine is a biological science, while being a doctor is often a social skill of managing expectations, understanding the insurance system, communicating effectively, and so on.
   --[The Difference Between Medicine and Being a Doctor](https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2022-07.html#e2022-07-03T09_00_55.htm)

7. Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.
   --[Oscar Wilde](https://philosiblog.com/2012/03/13/experience-is-the-name-everyone-gives-to-their-mistakes/)

8. A better formulation of DRY is SPOT (Single Point Of Truth). Definitions (code, data) that represent the same "truth", i.e. when one changes all have to change to represent a consistent truth, should be reduced to a single definition.
