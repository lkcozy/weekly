This map shows flood risk worldwide, highlighting the 1.81 billion people directly exposed to 1-in-100 year floods, considering both island and coastal flooding.

China & India have the largest amounts of people exposed to flooding, at 395 million and 390 million, respectively.

As both human and economic losses caused by floods continue, nations worldwide must focus on preventative infrastructure and restorative solutions for ecosystems and communities already affected and most at risk of flooding.

The AI21 labs trained a large language model called Jurassic-1 on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's 27 years of Opinions (legal judgments) in the Supreme Court, media interviews and public speeches. This corpus of text is the basis of the AI's ability to try and predict how she would respond to your questions.

You can ask Justice Ruth any YES/NO question within 150 words.

## Research

Continuous learning is the key attribute of great engineers. Unfortunately, years of experience correlate only slightly with programmer efficacy. Self-estimation(self-reported ability and comparison to peers ) and learning eagerness/behaviours (time spent learning, code review, testing, mentoring) are more predictive.

Programmers with higher efficacy

- read code more efficiently: focus on the most relevant parts of the code
- experienced lower cognitive load: sustained longer periods of work

Requiring a certain number of "years of experience" in hiring criteria has increasingly come under scrutiny.

1. [Cultivating Hospitality](https://kevinyien.com/blog/cultivating-hospitality.html)

The one key factor to consider when you grow your team: "The extent to which you welcome someone — especially those who look or act differently than you — is a measure of your hospitality.

Treat every new hire like they've been there the whole time. Explain old jokes. Create new jokes. Build new rituals. Make them the new veteran."

2. [Setting the Table Book Summary](https://medium.com/mbreads/book-summary-setting-the-table-8769bbec9d6e)

Half-autobiography, half-business building book — Danny Meyer's story of building a restaurant empire. Enlightened hospitality — put hospitality to work first for the people who work for you, guests, community, suppliers, and investors — in that order.

> Service is the technical delivery of our product. Hospitality is how the delivery of that product makes its recipient feel.

> The only way a company can grow, stay true to its soul, and remain consistently successful is to attract, hire, and keep great people. It's that simple, and it's that hard.

> It is critically important to lead by teaching, setting priorities, and holding people accountable.

> For most people, it's far more important to feel heard than to be agreed with.

> Change works only when people believe it is happening for them, not to them.

> Generosity of spirit and a gracious approach to problem-solving are, with few exceptions, the most effective way I know to earn lasting goodwill for your business.
