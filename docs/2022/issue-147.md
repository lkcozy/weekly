Whitebox is an advanced open-source geospatial data analysis platform. It now contains over 500 tools for processing various types of geospatial data.

WhiteboxTools doesn't compete with QGIS and ArcGIS/Pro, but rather it extends them. You can plug WhiteboxTools into QGIS and ArcGIS, giving you access to hundreds of additional tools for analyzing all kinds of geospatial data, including DEM data, satellite imagery, LiDAR point clouds, and vector data, embedded inside your GIS environment.

OpenAI's DALL-E 2 is a dream tool and existential threat to visual artists. DALL·E 2 can create original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles.

## Research

1. [Why was my scientific paper/grant rejected? ](https://butlerscicomm.com/what-to-do-when-the-importance-isnt-clear/)

Most scientific manuscripts and grants get rejected due to unclear importance. The main reasons for unclear extent in your paper/grant:

- GAPS in the field that your work seeks to fill are not clearly and directly stated.
- The IMPACT/IMPORTANCE of your work is not clearly and directly stated.
- It is not sufficiently related to the reader

The reader will NEVER interpret the text the way you want them to, so you need to spell out precisely what you want them to learn.

## Tool

1. [Commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/)

The complete solution for node.js command-line interfaces.

## Resources

1. [The Day You Became A Better Writer](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)

Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The primary technique is keeping things simple. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences.

Simple means getting rid of extra words. Write short sentences. Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence.

Your first sentence needs to grab the reader.

## Comments

1. Anything you might want to accomplish—executing a project at work, getting a new job, learning a new skill, starting a business— requires finding and putting to use the correct information. Your professional success and quality of life depend on your ability to manage information effectively.
   --[Building a Second Brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/)

2. Real questions are almost never settled in terms of right or wrong but rather how best to balance the competing equities of various solutions.
   --[On Sarcasm](https://boz.com/articles/sarcasm)

3. So, if you want to make a critique, then do it explicitly and earnestly. Take a position of your own and defend it. It takes a lot more work, but in exchange, it holds the promise to create a great deal more value for society.
   --[On Sarcasm](https://boz.com/articles/sarcasm)

4. The ultimate measure for a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenges and controversy.
   --[Martin Luther King Jr.](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-meaning-this-quotation-388597)
