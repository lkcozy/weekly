This article shows you how to build interactive Google Maps with R and include them in R Shiny dashboards. With Google Maps in R, you can give your users a familiar map and retain customizability by placing it within a Shiny dashboard.

2. [Using Geospatial Technologies to Map Hurricane Response](https://www.gislounge.com/geospatial-map-hurricane-response/)

Now, using satellite data and artificial intelligence, researchers have developed a way to potentially pinpoint where people might be trapped after a hurricane and provide relief to them quickly while monitoring a wide area, such as an entire state.

3. [Web Scraping Google Maps](https://serpdog.io/blog/web-scraping-google-maps)

In this tutorial, we will learn how to scrape this valuable Google Maps information with the help of Node JS. And at the end, we will see how Serpdog's | Google Maps Reviews API can help you scrape Google Maps Reviews without any extra effort, which we require in scraping Google.

1. [What is a proxy? Why is Nginx called a reverse proxy?](https://youtu.be/4NB0NDtOwIQ)

A forward proxy is a server that sits between a group of client machines and the internet.

A reverse proxy sits between the internet and the web servers. It intercepts client requests and talks to the web server on behalf of the clients.

1. [What does a VP of Engineering do?](https://karimfanous.substack.com/p/what-does-a-vpe-do)

The role of the VP of Engineering is to build and maintain the system that develops the products and services a business requiresã€‚

- People: build the engineering team.
- Process: These are activities related to how software gets built and released into the world.
- Planning: Product strategy & roadmap & budgets
- Misc: account & vendor & patents management

2. [Addressing Tech Debt](https://abinoda.substack.com/p/tech-debt)

The term "tech debt" is frequently tossed around without developers or business stakeholders clearly understanding the problem.

This article can help guide us toward having clearer discussions: what type of debt are we talking about, and what information demonstrates that it negatively affects a team's ability to deliver?

3. [The Open Guide to Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws)

![](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws/raw/master/figures/aws-market-landscape.png)

This guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices. It arose from discussion and editing over beers by several engineers who have used AWS extensively.

4. [B-Tree vs. LSM-Tree](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep29-online-gaming-protocol)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca0c770-fe3a-40cd-b4f4-7b719c650fdd_1981x1536.jpeg)

B-Tree is the most widely used indexing data structure in almost all relational databases. The basic unit of information storage in B-Tree is usually called a "page ."Looking up critical traces down the range of keys until the actual value is found.

LSM-Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree) is widely used by many NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra, LevelDB, and RocksDB. LSM trees maintain key-value pairs and are persisted to disk using a Sorted Strings Table (SSTable), in which the keys are sorted.

The biggest difference is probably this:

- **B-Tree enables faster reads**
- **LSM-Tree enables fast writes**

5. [Guiding Principle: Cross-Pollination Over Imposed Standards](https://jchyip.medium.com/guiding-principle-cross-pollination-over-imposed-standards-a2375d0e8de6)

Ensure everyone is aware of defaults but also has the autonomy to choose an alternate approach as appropriate.

You want to enable a better approach, which should be comparable to the default. Then, it's up to us to "promote" (or sell) the default properly regarding what it solves and how to leverage it effectively.

Don't assume people will understand or appreciate it without that marketing effort (documentation, how-to, demos, example code, etc.), even if it's an internal tool.
