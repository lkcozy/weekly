## Comments

1. We're quietly replacing an open web that connects and empowers with one that restricts and commoditizes people.
   --[Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/#/)

2. Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.
   --[John Kenneth Galbraith](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/05/17/change-view/#/)

3. There are three things you cannot buy. Fitness: You have to keep fit, whether you're rich or not. Diet: You cannot pay someone to be on a diet for you. I think that diet is the biggest sacrifice in my life. Then, looking after your soul. No one can possibly treat your soul but you yourself. This is something you can do through culture and philosophy.

4. Every perception is to some degree an act of creation, and every act of memory is to some degree an act of imagination.
