1. [Your Low-Power Wide-Area Network(LPWAN): Selecting The Best Location Positioning Option](https://www.iotforall.com/lpwan-location-choosing-the-best-option-for-your-use-case)

A big chunk of future growth in IoT devices is expected to come from low-power, wide-area networks. By 2025, it is likely that more than 2 billion devices will be connected through LPWAN.

Several different networks, such as NB-IoT, LoRaWAN, Sigfox or LTE Cat-M, offer these unique capabilities. However, the performance of these networks depends on accurate location capabilities.

The Global Positioning System is one of the most valuable inventions of the late 20th century.

This blog post explains how the satellites help a GPS receiver determine where it is, and I'll dive into the clever methods the system uses to make sure the signals sent from space are reliably decoded on Earth.

3. [A normie's guide to rollups](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/a-normies-guide-to-rollups)

Blockchain scalability was a big problem. But, most of the current debate concerns which scalability solution will win. The author breaks down some of the Ethereum scalability solutions that have been explored in the past five years — and explains how each of these was a stepping stone to what may be emerging as the winner: Rollups.

A research group from ETH Zurich presents a perceptive locomotion controller for quadrupedal robots that combines fast locomotion and exceptional robustness on challenging terrain.

## Tools

1. [modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin)

![](https://github.com/modin-project/modin/raw/master/docs/img/Modin_Speedup.svg)

Modin is a drop-in replacement for pandas. While pandas is single-threaded, Modin lets you instantly speed up your workflows by scaling pandas so it uses all of your cores. Modin works especially well on larger datasets, where pandas becomes painfully slow or runs out of memory.

- Have a Slow Hiring Process
  - The better the developer, the quicker they'll find a job.
  - Have a multi-month hiring process as a small unknown company.
  - Take your time replying or giving any feedback. The longer, the better.
- Test Them Until They Give Up
  - Test them on things they don't do day-to-day as this will make it harder for them to pass.
  - Make them do the test on a whiteboard to throw them off balance.
  - Ask unanswerable brain teaser questions.
  - Have an extremely long take-home test.
- Stay Local in Small Populated Areas
  - Don't hire remote developers.
  - Don't offer any relocation assistance.
  - Make them travel large distances for 30-minute interviews at their own expense. Especially if you're in a small country town.
- Demand Passion
  - Demand passionate answers as to why people want to change the world with your company.
  - Demand that people spend all of their free time on tech and side projects.
- Underpay
  - Pay lower salaries than all the other companies in your area.
  - Offer equity that is only granted after multiple years of service.

## Comments

1. I'm still very opposed to the idea of taking a technology and then searching a problem for it. Why? Back in 2017 during the first hype cycle, blockchain companies raised hundreds of millions with ICOs.

4 years later in the web3 era, there is not a single product aside from trading/finance that got traction. Use cases like storing the history of a car on-chain, transparent supply chains, public voting... this all sounds interesting but never made it to product-market fit.

2. Just like there will come a day you will go outside for the last time, have your favorite meal a last time, listen to a song for the last time or breathe for the last time. It's a sobering thought. But until that day you have plenty of opportunities to do all those things, and that includes loving new people!
