## Comments

1. We're going to have a great power conflict. And there are no courts that you go to when you have disagreements; it's a power conflict.
   --[Ray Dalio](https://thehustle.co/ray-dalio-chat/)

2. It's difficult for one person to be really good at the whole stack. Since you are a beginner, I would recommend you to concentrate on one part: frontend or backend or infrastructure. With time, you will gain confidence to meddle in all areas.

3. The best thing founders can do is subtraction. It's much, much, much easier to add things than it is to remove things. Adding things is a lot more expensive than removing things. However, it requires some measure of bravery and risk-taking.

4. A good marriage is one in which each spouse secretly thinks he or she got the better deal, and this is true also of our friendships.
