The relationship between product and engineering is talked about often, but it is an area that can appear more as an art than a science. This article serves as a guide for evaluating the relationship between the two functions in your organization and correcting any areas that are off track.

We see the amazing benchmarks that some NoSQL databases provide, and we say, "wow, they are so much faster/better/scalable than relational databases." But we don't ask ourselves why.

Instead of asking, "how are they so much better?" we should ask, "what are they giving up?"

Non-relational databases can scale because they frequently throw out many guarantees that make relational databases so powerful. Any time you make one of these tradeoffs, you move the complexity from the database into your application.

The next time you hear someone describe relational databases as yesterday's technology, or the next time you see someone assume a relational database can't handle the needs of their unproven MVP, stop and ask them how they will account for the tradeoffs they're making.
