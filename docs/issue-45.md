1. So don’t focus on building the product, focus on solving the problem.

2. Every innovative startup begins life targeting the 2% of the market that is the most forward thinking. But in order for that startup to scale, it needs to build a bridge to the other 98% of the market and push those customers into the future.

I have worked at two startups now where we made the fatal mistake of being profitable. If you make this mistake then the investors will swoop in and demand you spend more on marketing and AWS infrastructure, because we're scaling up to 5 billion users of course.
Of course we started spending all the money on new people and AWS, and soon there was no money.

At one point we were dumping like \$15K a month on AWS for a dozen unnecessary over-engineered toys that nobody was using. This is the real cost of AWS.

I'd love to see Amazon's data on money invested vs actual user traffic for small startups, that's got to be some of the most interesting and valuable data on earth. Forget companies, I'll bet Jeff is sitting around predicting when entire industries rise and fall weeks before anyone else based just on this data.

3. The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled
