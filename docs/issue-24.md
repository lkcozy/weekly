GQL is a new language being developed and maintained by the same international working group that also maintains the SQL standard.

Many vendors, researchers and users agree that graph databases can be developed using non-relational storage and runtime models – a.k.a. native graph technology. Examples include Neo4j’s industry-leading graph database platform and the new Redis Labs graph product.

However, they most definitely want a language – like Cypher – that covers insertion and maintenance of data, and not just data querying. And SQL is unlikely to be the right model for a graph-centric language that can “compose over graphs” (i.e. takes graphs as query inputs and spits out a graph as a result, the same way SQL can read tables and form result sets which are new tables).

GQL will build on work in openCypher Morpheus, which brings Cypher to Apache Spark, and the inspiration of G-CORE from the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC), to give users a composable graph query language, enabling all of those features.

Combining all three of these streams will make GQL into the conceptual equal of SQL … and then some.

PostgREST serves a fully RESTful API from any existing PostgreSQL database. It provides a cleaner, more standards-compliant, faster API than you are likely to write from scratch.
