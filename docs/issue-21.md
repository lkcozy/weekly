## Tool

1. [MazeBattles]()

![](https://github.com/HenryDavidZhu/MazeBattles.com/raw/master/public/img/screenshot.png)

Built a site using Node.js and Socket.io where users race against each other to solve mazes generated using's Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm. Uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm to solve mazes. Features a single player and one-on-one mode.

2. [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async)

```js
async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results) {
    // results is now an array of stats for each file
});

async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) {
  fs.access(filePath, function(err) {
    callback(null, !err)
  });
}, function(err, results) {
    // results now equals an array of the existing files
});

async.parallel([
    function(callback) { ... },
    function(callback) { ... }
], function(err, results) {
    // optional callback
});

async.series([
    function(callback) { ... },
    function(callback) { ... }
]);
```

Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript.

There are several awesome lists on GitHub that collect and curate the best resources for a specific programming language, framework, platform, etc. This site builds on top of those lists, but only shows repos and lets you filter by category, license, time last committed.

1. [Advice to my young self: to succeed in your career, forget side projects and focus on your job](https://manuel.darcemont.fr/posts/focus-on-jour-job/)

Many young programmers like to do some side projects of their own after work. The author recommends **not to do side projects aimlessly, especially not to do what you like, but do those side projects that are directly related to your work.**

Shallow side projects are useful to develop a first opinion about a technology that will need to be confirmed with a more elaborate project.

The best way to dig a new technology is to practice it in your daily job. Youâ€™ll spend seven hours a day on it and will quickly become infinitely more proficient than if you just barely used it on nights and weekends.

2. [LET'S MAKE THE WORST REACT EVER!](https://zserge.com/posts/worst-react-ever/)

The author explains how to implement the simplest React, which supports JSX syntax and some basic API. The compressed code does not exceed 1KB. This article can be used to understand the principle of React.
