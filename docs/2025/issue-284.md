In the age of AI agents, organizational structures will shift from fixed, hierarchical forms to fluid and dynamic ones, mirroring the transition of software from deterministic (pre-programmed steps) to non-deterministic (AI reasoning through tasks independently), with hybrid teams of humans and agents forming flexibly based on specific goals.

- Software is evolving from deterministic (pre-determined, human-programmed steps) to non-deterministic (AI reasons through tasks with unclear upfront steps).
- Organizational structures will follow a similar shift, moving from fixed, hierarchical org charts to fluid and dynamic forms.
- Future organizations will consist of hybrid teams (humans + AI agents) that assemble flexibly based on the specific job or goal at hand.
- AI’s improved reasoning abilities will enable it to determine optimal team structures tailored to desired outcomes, driving this fluidity.

Counter Arguments

- Human resistance to rapid structural changes or reliance on familiar hierarchies could hinder the adoption of fluid organizational models, even with AI support.
- Non-deterministic AI behavior could introduce unpredictability in team coordination, as the lack of pre-defined steps might lead to inconsistent approaches to tasks.

- Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning "on demand".
- Teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words.
- Only compare yourself to younger you, never to others.

Developers and Open Source authors now have many services offering free tiers, but finding them all takes time to make informed decisions.

This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings with free developer tiers.

## Individual Contributor Track

- **Junior Engineer**: Mostly learning, assisting others, handling simpler tasks.
- **Mid Level Engineer**: Executes well-defined tasks independently.
- **Senior Engineer**: Plans and executes initiatives. Mentors others.
- **Staff Engineer**: Improves everything they touch—code, process. Elevates others. Proposes initiatives. Works across multiple teams.
- **Principal Engineer**: Similar to Staff, but with cross-departmental scope.

## Management / Leadership Track

- **Engineering Manager**: Responsible for outcomes of one team; hires, develops, retains talent; coordinates with stakeholders.
- **Senior Engineering Manager**: Same as above but for multiple teams or larger scope.
- **Director of Engineering**: Executive level; responsible for a department composed of multiple teams. Focuses on systems more than individuals; manages budget; business-oriented.
- **VP / Head of Engineering**: Technical counterpart to the CTO; responsible for engineering culture, quality, and process. Larger orgs may have multiple VPs.
- **CTO**: Member of C-suite; accountable for business outcomes via technological strategies.

4. [The Post-Performance Review Guide No One Talks About, Part 1](https://daydreamsinruby.com/blog/2025-02-03-reflecting-on-your-performance-review/)

"With your manager, or on your own, attempt to determine which piece of feedback is most impacting your success in your role or at the company and then take some time to figure out what you may be able to do about it." -- Feedback is essential, but not all is equal in value. Know what you're optimizing for, have it in writing (and share it), and then decide which areas you need to improve on to get there.

## Comments

1. Thus, most code will be written by kids/students rather than software engineers. This is the same trend as video, photos, and other social media. Of course this seems surprising because today most software is being written by highly trained adults, who are generally time poor but money rich. This will change, and it means that over time, software will become dominated by youth culture the same way that social media is. Are you ready for software memes? Or memes in the form of software? It’s all coming. --[Vibe Coding, Some Thoughts and Predictions](https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/predictionsthoughts-on-vibe-coding)

2. Every feature is owned by a group. Build for production use, not demo use. --[Product Principles at GitLab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/)

3. 0-1 sales talent does not exist. In a startup’s early days, the Founder is the product.

4. If a piece of feedback instantly makes you defensive, there’s a good chance it’s exactly what you need to hear.

5. For aspiring writers: Your ultimate goal isn't building a writing habit. It's falling so in love with interesting ideas that you can’t help but tell the world about them. Writing is the medium—not the objective.
