Ncurator is a "Knowledge Base AI Q&A Assistant." It's designed to help you manage and analyze your personal knowledge base. Here's a breakdown of its key features and functionalities:

- Knowledge Base Management: It allows you to create a personal knowledge base by importing various types of documents (PDF, Docx), crawling webpages, importing browser bookmarks, and connecting to services like Notion, Gmail, and Google Drive.
- AI-Powered Q&A: You can ask questions, and the AI will search your knowledge base to find and organize relevant answers.
- Semantic Search: It uses semantic and keyword search technology to intelligently analyze your queries and retrieve the most relevant information.
- Data Security: All data is stored locally on your device.
- Offline Use: After downloading a local LLM model, it can be used offline.
- Browser Integration: It's designed to work within your browser, offering convenient features.

5. [Autogenerate Show Notes](https://ajcwebdev.com/autogen-shownotes/)

The article outlines an end-to-end scripting workflow to generate automatic show notes with large language models (LLMs) from audio and video transcripts using Whisper.cpp, Llama.cpp, and Commander.js.

## Tool

1. [upfetch](https://github.com/L-Blondy/up-fetch)

```ts
import { upfetch } from "./upfetch";
import { z } from "zod";
const user = await upfetch("https://a.b.c/users/1", {
  schema: z.object({
    id: z.number(),
    name: z.string(),
    avatar: z.string().url(),
  }),
});
```

upfetch is an advanced fetch client builder with standard schema validation, automatic response parsing, smart defaults and more. Designed to make data fetching type-safe and developer-friendly while keeping the familiar fetch API.

1. [Ideas from "A Philosophy of Software Design"](https://www.16elt.com/2024/09/25/first-book-of-byte-sized-tech/index.html)

A Philosophy of Software Design emphasizes that complexity is the silent killer of software systems, accumulating through seemingly small decisions. The book describes the symptoms of complexity and how to treat them.

- Zero-tolerance towards complexity by centralizing logic to reduce change amplification and cognitive load.
- Smaller components may not be better for modularity unless they share information and are used together.
- Exception handling causes complexity, can be reduced by defining errors out of existence, masking exceptions, and exception aggregation.

CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates reading and writing data, introduced by Greg Young in 2010, based on the Command-Query Separation (CQS) principle by Bertrand Meyer, gaining popularity in software development for its benefits in performance and scalability.

- CQRS divides an application into the Command Side (handling create, update, delete requests) and the Query Side (handling read requests).
- Originating from the CQS principle, CQRS takes it further by separating command and query responsibilities at an architectural level.
- Widely used in domains like e-commerce and financial systems for performance, scalability, and complexity management.
- Detailed information on CQRS and a decision matrix on its usage provided in the article.

3. [Let's build a Chrome extension that steals everything](https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/spy-chrome-extension)

The article discusses building a Chrome extension that demonstrates the potential for data theft, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with Chrome extensions, and highlighting the risks associated with installing extensions without caution.

## Comments

1. The meaning you give work determines its difficulty.A coder working on a passion project works 12 hours straight and calls it energizing. That same programmer, doing maintenance on legacy code they consider meaningless, feels exhausted after 2 hours. Your relationship with the work shapes its weight more than the work itself.

2. It takes inordinate courage to introspect, to confront oneself, to accept one’s limitations—scientists are seeing more and more evidence that we are specifically designed by mother nature to fool ourselves. --Nassim Taleb on the bravery required to remain skeptical

3. Your choices determine your trajectory.

4. Waiting for perfect conditions is how otherwise intelligent people keep themselves stuck. Two entrepreneurs spot the same opportunity. One builds elaborate plans; the other tests crude prototype. The planner is still planning when the tester sells their company. While you wait for perfect conditions, others are creating them.

5. An imperfect solution that exists outperforms a perfect one that doesn’t. Facebook wasn’t the first social network – it was just the one that kept iterating and showing up. The Wright brothers weren’t the most educated aviation pioneers, but they were the ones who got a plane off the ground. What you build matters more than what you could have built.

6. If you’re trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right. --Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham on fooling yourself:

7. Things happen in life that you don’t want to happen—whether you lose a game, things don’t go well at work, or something happens with your child. There are many moments in our personal and professional lives that don’t go the way we want. How do you deal with them? Do you handle them with class and integrity, with courage and resilience? Are you able to share your emotions with others? Do you have people in your life who can help you through those challenges? I’m blessed to have had people walk through those moments with me. They always say, “Double the pleasure and divide the pain,” and that’s what relationships are all about. When you care for and love those around you, they give back—and that’s where the reward comes. --Tom Brady (lightly edited) on how the right people in your life double the pleasure and divide the pain
