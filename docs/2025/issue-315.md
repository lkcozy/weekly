## Comments

1. I have never worshipped money and I never worked for money. I worked for pride and accomplishment. Money can become a nuisance. It's a hell of a lot more fun chasing it than getting it. The fun is in the race. --Ray Kroc, who was instrumental in turning McDonald’s into one of the most successful brands in the world

2. All complaining comes at the expense of improving.

3. Positive action produces positive attitudes, which produce a positive atmosphere.

4. There are 3 kinds of people: those who make it happen, those who watch it happen, and occasionally, someone who doesn't know what happened.

5. Sometimes you don't need to be great, you just need to be better than the competition.
