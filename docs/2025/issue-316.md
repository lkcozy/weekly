## AI

1. [Team dynamics after AI](https://mechanicalsurvival.com/blog/team-dynamics-after-ai/)

> Skills = senses through which we perceive work/problems; expertise arises from deepening those senses.

AI reshapes team dynamics by amplifying small, well-aligned groups but also risks flattening skills and eroding deep expertise. While tools accelerate production, true bottlenecks lie in **sense-making, coordination, and decision quality**.

Over-automating information and compressing context weakens shared understanding. Teams should preserve niche expertise, translators between disciplines, and learning pathways for juniors to sustain long-term capability.

Rather than chasing efficiency, organizations should design intentional collaboration systems that balance automation with human depth — valuing clarity, diversity, and purposeful tool use.

**AI’s promise is not faster output, but smarter, more connected, and more meaningful teamwork.**

## Tool

1. [OpenZL](https://github.com/facebook/openzl)

OpenZL delivers high compression ratios while preserving high speed, a level of performance that is out of reach for generic compressors.

2. [Feed me up Scotty](https://gitlab.com/vincenttunru/feed-me-up-scotty/)

RSS feeds for arbitrary websites, using CSS selectors.

Teams overestimate coding speed as the limiting factor. The bigger bottlenecks are ideation, decision-making, and validation.

Figuring out what to build, whether it will matter, whether the market wants it.

The cost of building something that turns out to be the wrong thing is high -even if "coding" was cheap or fast.

The advent of AI and "vibe-coding"(rapid prototyping, less hand-coding) is reducing the cost of the code-writing part, which further makes the non-coding parts (validation, decision, learning) relatively more important.

## Comments

1.  Everyone searches for opportunities while running from problems, missing that they’re the same thing. Problems aren’t obstacles to opportunity, they ARE the opportunity.

2.  When people feel like you deserve more than you have, they’ll go out of their way to help you. But the minute you forget you were once the underdog, they’ll root against you.

3.  It’s a lot easier than you think to ‘beat the odds’ because the odds are based on average people. Show up and elevate. --Dr. Julie Gurner on beating the odds

4.  I've been telling this to Individual Contributors (IC) I have managed for years: Build and talk. Those two verbs — build and talk — are not opposites. They compound. For those who don't like to speak or write too much, you can also show it by considering an apprenticeship where you can lead (as an expert) and have others watch and assist you. --[Karpathy Is Wrong. Write That Post, Build That Slide Deck!](https://world.hey.com/joaoqalves/karpathy-is-wrong-write-that-post-build-that-slide-deck-9d1a6893)

5.  The happiest people I know don't have perfect lives. But they do have one thing in common: They've mastered the art of moving on. They don't keep score, they don't cling to what if, they don't dwell. There’s a hell of a lot of progress hiding in not staying stuck in the past.

6.  I have a mental illness that makes me think that people will change their minds if I present the correct arguments with the appropriate facts and data.
