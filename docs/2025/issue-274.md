## Resources

1. [Summary of All I Want to Know is Where I’m Going to Die](https://fs.blog/summary-bevelin-all-i-want-to-know/)

- Wisdom is prevention. Prevention is easier than cure. Avoiding problems is simpler than fixing them. Buffett and Munger emphasize the importance of foresight and preparation.
- The fundamental algorithm of life: repeat what works. Success comes from identifying what works and doing more of it. Simplicity and consistency are key.
- The wise of every generation discover the same truths. Avoid learning everything through personal experience. Instead, study the successes and failures of others.
- Avoid distraction. Focus is critical. Successful people say “no” to almost everything to concentrate on what truly matters.
- Spend time thinking. Deep thinking and reflection are essential for good decision-making. Writing out your thoughts can clarify and improve your reasoning.
- Position yourself for opportunity. Instead of predicting the future, position yourself to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Maintain flexibility and preparedness.
- Invert: Much of success comes from simply avoiding common paths to failure.
- Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance. Success often comes from avoiding obvious mistakes rather than pursuing complex strategies.
- The weakest link causes the problem. Identify and address the weakest link in any system or decision. Strengthening the weakest point often yields the greatest improvement.
- Beware of Leverage： While leverage can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses. It’s a double-edged sword that can lead to ruin.

## Comments

1. Stick to the basics:

Be reliable.
Do your job.
Speak for yourself.
Outcome over ego.
Focus on the details.
See challenges as opportunities.
Go to bed smarter than when you woke up.

2. You don’t need to be smarter than others to outperform them if you can out-position them. Anyone looks like a genius when they’re in a good position, and even the smartest person looks like an idiot when they’re in a bad one. --[Clear Thinking](https://fs.blog/clear/)

3. Neither Warren nor I are smart enough to make decisions with no time to think. We make actual decisions very rapidly, but that’s because we have spent so much time preparing ourselves by quietly reading. --Charlie Munger on preparation

4. Failure is rarely the result of some isolated event. Rather, it is a consequence of a long list of accumulated little failures which happen as a result of too little discipline. Failure occurs each time we fail to think … today, act … today, care, strive, climb, learn, or just keep going … today. --Jim Rohn on failure
