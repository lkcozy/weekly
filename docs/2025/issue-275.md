## GeoSpatial

1. [Evolution of Geospatial Data ETL & Analytics](https://geoaiunpacked.substack.com/p/geoai-unpacked-3-evolution-of-geospatial)

The article discusses the evolution of geospatial data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and the geospatial industry over the past few decades. It covers the basics of geospatial data types, traditional GIS practices, modern geospatial technologies, the current ecosystem and marketplace, and challenges in geospatial data ETL

- Geospatial data types: Vector (points, lines, polygons) and raster (grid cells) data
- Traditional GIS: On-premise processing with hardware constraints and specialized software like ArcGIS and QGIS
- Modern geospatial technologies: Cloud-native solutions, new data formats (COG, Zarr, GeoParquet), and cloud-based analytics
- Ecosystem and marketplace:
  - Government entities (e.g., NGA) with large budgets
  - Big Tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) entering the market
  - Startups in various domains (location intelligence, data management, visualization)
- Challenges in geospatial data ETL:
  - Lack of one-size-fits-all solutions
  - Handling large datasets
  - Data quality and standardization
  - Interoperability between platforms and formats
  - Complex API design for spatiotemporal data
  - Coordinate system transformations

The article concludes by noting the significant advancements in geospatial data ETL and analytics, while highlighting areas for improvement, such as geospatial machine learning and developing no-code/low-code tools to democratize access to geospatial insights.

2. [Pan Sharpening in GIS](https://www.geographyrealm.com/pan-sharpening-gis/)

Pan sharpening is a technique in GIS and remote sensing that combines high-resolution black-and-white panchromatic images with lower-resolution multispectral images to enhance spatial resolution.

- Landsat satellites offer panchromatic bands that provide finer spatial detail compared to multispectral bands.
- Pan sharpening involves aligning images, applying fusion algorithms, and fine-tuning the resulting image.
- Benefits include improved visualization and analysis, while limitations include spectral distortion and computational intensity.

2. [‚ÄúLooks good to me‚Äù is a lazy default](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/looks-good-to-me-is-a-lazy-default-managers-should-give-feedback)

Every time a manager says "looks good" about mediocre work, their team's standards decrease, leading to normalization of mediocrity and poor execution.

Managers have two common reasons for not providing detailed feedback: fixing the work themselves seems faster or they prioritize speed over quality.

Investing time in training and giving specific, actionable feedback to your team can lead to long-term benefits and higher standards.

- Saying "looks good" to subpar work gradually lowers team standards
- Managers often avoid giving feedback because it's challenging and time-consuming
- Providing regular, detailed feedback is crucial for improving team performance and developing high performers
- Managers should invest time in training their team rather than constantly correcting work
- To give effective feedback, managers should:
  - Identify areas for improvement
  - Explain how to enhance the work
  - Share examples of excellence
  - Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Raising standards requires consistent reinforcement through daily interactions, not just annual speeches

The next time your direct report sends you something to review, ask yourself:

- Do I REALLY think this looks good?
- What would make this excellent?
- What did they do well, and what could they improve?
- What‚Äôs one piece of feedback that will make the biggest impact in improving this?
- What‚Äôs something I‚Äôm noticing, that I can point out so my direct report learns to see what I‚Äôm seeing?

## Comments

1. When you join a new team, focus on three aspects to understand its state. Audit to learn what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong.(1)Process(2)Technology(3)People.For each, try to analyze what you can change or influence and understand what you can‚Äôt change but are concerned about. --[Audit your team in three pillars](https://candost.blog/notes/3b7/)
