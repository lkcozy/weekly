## AI

1. [Will AI agents replace SaaS?](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/ai-agents-replace-saas/)

AI agents are software systems that can perform tasks typically done by humans, such as data input, collection, analysis, and interpretation. They can manage schedules, plan trips, or handle budgeting.

Why SaaS Isn't Going Away (Yet)

The author argues that AI agents are more likely to complement SaaS rather than replace it entirely. AI agents are effective at getting you most of the way to your desired outcome, but human intervention is still needed for nuanced decision-making and complex problem-solving.

While AI agents will undoubtedly transform our interaction with software, the complex systems behind the scenes will continue to rely on the foundation of SaaS. The future likely holds a collaborative relationship between AI agents and SaaS, each amplifying the other's strengths.

- Cursor rules: It's a way to give Cursor project-specific instructions. Here's what you need to know:
- Notepads are like supercharged sticky notes for your code. They bridge the gap between composers and chat interactions.
  - Notepads are great for documenting project architecture decisions, development guidelines, reusable code templates, team-specific rules and frequently referenced materials.
- @web symbol: Cursor constructs a search query based on the query and the context you’ve provided, and searches the web to find relevant information as additional context.

3. [DiffRhythm](https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm)

![](https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm/raw/main/src/diffrhythm.jpg)

DiffRhythm (Chinese: 谛韵, Dì Yùn) is the first open-sourced diffusion-based music generation model that is capable of creating full-length songs. The name combines "Diff" (referencing its diffusion architecture) with "Rhythm" (highlighting its focus on music and song creation). The Chinese name 谛韵 (Dì Yùn) phonetically mirrors "DiffRhythm", where "谛" (attentive listening) symbolizes auditory perception, and "韵" (melodic charm) represents musicality.

## GeoSpatial

1. [A Beginner S Guide To Geospatial With Duckdb Spatial And Motherduck](https://motherduck.com/blog/geospatial-for-beginner-duckdb-spatial-motherduck/)

![TODAY, THE MODERN GIS STACK](https://motherduck.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotherduck-com-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Fgeo_01_01_18a660fb64.png&w=1200&q=75)

This article introduces geospatial analysis and how DuckDB, along with MotherDuck, simplifies working with location-based data.

DuckDB's Geospatial Capabilities

- DuckDB offers built-in geospatial functions and a GDAL-based COPY function for reading and writing various geospatial file formats.
- GDAL is a transformation library that helps read, convert, and process different types of location-based data.

Geospatial in Action with DuckDB and MotherDuck

- MotherDuck extends DuckDB with serverless, collaborative features.
- Converting Coordinates to Addresses: DuckDB can use the HTTP Client Extension to query APIs like OpenStreetMap to convert coordinates to addresses directly in SQL.

## Comments

1. Optimism is a performance-enhancing drug that’s both legal and free.While pessimists write reports, optimists write history.

2. If I wanted to implement something new into my game, I’d see it and try incorporating it immediately. I wasn’t scared of missing, looking bad, or being embarrassed. That’s because I always kept the end result, the long game, in my mind. --Kobe Bryant on having the courage to look like a fool

3. Big thinking uses data to validate or refine a path toward an ultimate goal. Minimal thinking uses data to guess whether a small product is worth keeping around for another round of iteration. One has the capacity to shape entire industries, while the other might produce fleeting hype that disappears after the next pivot. This dynamic has real consequences for employees, as well. Work cultures that focus on constant short sprints can breed burnout. Engineers come to see their labor as disposable. Projects start and die with whiplash speed. When there is no overarching aim, workers eventually lose morale. Companies that think in maximums, by contrast, tend to inspire loyalty. --Arjun Shah captures the notion of maximal thinking well
