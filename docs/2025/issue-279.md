Cursor, Windsurf, and Copilot are major contenders in the AI coding assistant space, aiming to make developers' lives easier.

Each tool offers unique features such as tab completion, code generation, chat capabilities, terminal integration, context awareness, multi-file support, AI agents, Figma design-to-code conversion, code review, customization options, and AI-generated commit messages.

Copilot stands out with support for multiple IDEs, while Cursor and Windsurf are built on top of Visual Studio Code.

Here's why Cursor still edges out:

- Reliability: While both offer similar feature sets, Cursor consistently delivers more accurate and contextually relevant results.
- Power features: Small but significant additions like auto-generated commit messages and advanced bug finding capabilities give it an edge.
- Maturity: As a more established tool, Cursor has had time to iron out edge cases and optimize its workflows.

The preferred workflow looks like this:

- Our design team works in Figma
- Visual Copilot converts the designs to code
- Iterate on the code using Cursor

This project is managed by `devenv`. It consists of a Next.js application and a Postgres database with the `pgvector` extension installed. The query uses the L2 distance `<->` to calcualate similarity.

2. [Proud Versioning](https://pridever.org/)

Given a version number PROUD.DEFAULT.SHAME, increment the:

- **PROUD** version when you make changes you are really proud of
- **DEFAULT** version when you make a release that's okay
- **SHAME** version when you are fixing things that are too embarrassing to admit

## Comments

1. The hardest truth about happiness is that it’s a choice. Watch how people discuss their problems. They’ll spend hours explaining why things are terrible, how unfair life is, and how others need to change. But suggest they might have the power to improve things and they suddenly have countless reasons why that’s impossible. Self-pity feels safer than responsibility.

2. Persistence isn’t just pushing harder—it’s having energy that demands new ideas. Think of a founder solving a problem. Someone with just determination keeps trying the same approach. But a truly persistent founder has a restless energy that demands new solutions. When one approach fails, their energy compels them to imagine new ones. This cycle—energy demanding imagination, imagination feeding energy—is rare. Energy without imagination is force. Energy with imagination is persistence.

3. To free us from the expectations of others, to give us back to ourselves—there lies the great, the singular power of self-respect. --Joan Didion reminds us that self-respect blooms when we break free from others’ expectations

4. Overthinking is the biggest waste of human energy. Trust yourself, make a decision, and gain more experience. There is no such thing as perfect. You cannot think your way into perfection, just take action. --Sylvester McNutt III urges us to stop overthinking

5. A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short. --Schopenhauer exploring why what you don’t read is as important as what you do

6. Startups don’t care about marginal features because their success is entirely dominated by finding a single successful feature that anybody wants to pay for. Big companies by definition have at least one successful feature that’s already driving lots of revenue, so they care a lot about marginal features. 1% of Google Ads or AWS S3 revenue is a lot of money. Big companies are thus incentivized to keep adding complexity until it’s literally impossible to add any more. --Why Are Big Tech Companies So Slow

7. Nothing drains a high performer faster than realizing their reward for excellence is cleaning up someone else’s incompetence.
