1. [Comparing AWS S3 with Cloudflare R2: Price, Performance and User Experience](https://kerkour.com/aws-s3-vs-cloudflare-r2-price-performance-user-experience)

Cloudflare's R2 storage service is a cheaper alternative to AWS S3, offering free egress fees, although it comes with some limitations in performance and user experience.

- R2's pricing is more cost-effective compared to S3, especially for scenarios involving frequent data access.
- R2's performance may vary depending on access method and usage.
- R2 offers a simpler user experience than S3 but lacks full compatibility with the S3 API.
- The decision between R2 and S3 depends on factors like latency sensitivity, existing architecture, and organizational preferences.

2. [On Good Software Engineers](https://candost.blog/on-good-software-engineers/)

A good software engineer is defined as someone who can be trusted to progress a project, deliver solutions by collaborating with the team, and consistently produce high-quality work. This definition applies to engineers at all levels, from junior to senior and beyond, with expectations scaled according to experience.

Key characteristics of good software engineers include:

- Effective communication and collaboration skills
- Understanding of organizational processes and ability to navigate them
- Proactive approach to learning about their work environment
- Commitment to embedding quality in their deliverables
- Ability to understand stakeholder needs and adapt their approach
- Focus on reducing code complexity and maintaining high quality
- Reliability and adaptability in changing environments
- Team-oriented mindset, regardless of personality type
- Great engineers possess all these qualities and take proactive steps to improve - processes and solve problems without waiting for permission.

## Comments

1. Establishing authority with command doesnâ€™t work; it generates resentment. Building authority demands showing vulnerability, accepting failure, and building trust. Then, people will follow the authority even more. The same applies to authoritative products (full 5-star ratings are too good to be true).--[Candost](https://candost.blog/notes/33b/)

2. Bad bosses keep people stuck in dead-end jobs. Good bosses create opportunities for people to grow and advance. Great bosses encourage people to pursue growth and advancement even if it means leaving for another organization.
