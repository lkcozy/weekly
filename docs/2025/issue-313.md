The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a solution to this fragmentation.

MCP provides a standardized way for AI systems to connect with any data source or tool. Major technology companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, have already adopted this protocol, signaling its emergence as a universal standard for AI connectivity.

Think of MCP as a universal adapter for artificial intelligence. Just as USB-C provides a single standard that connects phones, laptops, monitors, and countless other devices, MCP creates one standard way for AI models to connect with any data source or tool.

The Model Context Protocol exists as both a specification and actual working code.

- The specification defines the rules and standards for how AI systems should communicate with external data sources.
- The implementations are the actual software libraries and tools that developers use to build these connections.
