AI can help us to provide more efficient and safer air travel.

**Why it matters**: With demand for air travel expected to double before 2040, there has never been a greater need for Artificially Intelligent technology to support human teams in-charge of airport efficiency, safety and innovation.

**How it works**: The Apron AI, ingests video streams (preferably from existing cameras) and turns this video data into structured data. This is typically timestamped about turnaround events (e.g. bridge connected, catering on stand, pushback truck connectedâ€¦). Furthermore, the AI can be trained to recognize any events of interest that are visible on the available video streams.

It is a system that learns and offers a predictive analysis which assists airlines and airports with managing their operations. Currently there are a number of airports which are being prepared for a full roll out, while 20-30 pilot programmes are being trialled across the globe. The aim of these pilot programmes is to demonstrate to potential customers the capabilities and value that the product can provide.

![El Grapho](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericdrowell/ElGrapho/master/img/elgrapho-examples.png)

El Grapho is a high performance WebGL graph data visualization engine. El Grapho can support millions of interactive nodes and edges in any modern browser.

If you need to build a graph visualization for the web of any kind, such as a tree, force directed graph, network graph, etc., and scale and performance are important to you, then El Grapho is a great option. El Grapho was built to push the limits of modern browsers.

2. [ScreenDump](https://screendump.techulus.com/)

An online screenshot tool. As long as the user enters the web address, it will display the screenshots of various devices, which is quite convenient.

The C3.ai COVID-19 Data Lake pre-establishes the important linkages in the disparate COVID-19 data sets sourced from all over the globe, so that researchers can easily navigate and explore the data features that may be of interest (e.g., diagnosis, age, locale, preexisting condition, etc.) and can perform sophisticated data science on those data.
