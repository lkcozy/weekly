One reason why there has been an expanded interest in computer vision in spatial analytics is the development of edge computing, which aims to bring cloud-based system analytics and data closer together to enable faster computation.

Tools such as OpenVINO aim to enable users to have much faster processing of video and other forms of visual data to enable complex computer vision tasks that can auto-detect features and provide information about objects more quickly.

Tasks such as segmentation, object detection, similarity measures between objects, action recognition, depth estimation, and many other tasks are incorporate as models that can be used without having to recreate them. Service tasks could then be accomplished more quickly since they only need training data, where they can even be configured to use Internet of Things (IoT) or other remote technologies that provide data to the service.

OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that solve a variety of tasks including emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others. Based on latest generations of artificial neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent and attention-based networks, the toolkit extends computer vision and non-vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. It accelerates applications with high-performance, AI and deep learning inference deployed from edge to cloud.
