Georeferencing in QGIS is the process of aligning a digital image of a map with geographical coordinates. This tutorial explains how to georeference a scanned map using Google Earth Pro and the Georeferencer tool in QGIS.

- Georeferencing is essential for integrating scanned maps into a GIS system.
- Google Earth Pro can be used to select and import a topographic map to be georeferenced.
- Ground control points are used to align the map with real-world coordinates.
- After georeferencing, the scanned map can be used with other spatial data in GIS applications.

## AI/ML

Replicate lets you run machine learning models with a cloud API, without having to understand the intricacies of machine learning or manage your own infrastructure. You can run open-source models that other people have published, or package and publish your own models. Those models can be public or private.

> A prediction is an object that represents a single result from running the model, including the inputs that you provided, the outputs that the model returned, as well as other metadata like the model version, the user who created it, the status of the prediction, and timestamps.
