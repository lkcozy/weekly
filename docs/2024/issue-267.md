AirTags work by leveraging a combination of Bluetooth technology and the vast network of Apple devices to help you locate your lost items.
Here's a breakdown of how they function:

- Bluetooth Signal: Each AirTag emits a secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby Apple devices (iPhones, iPads, etc.) within the Find My network.
- Find My Network: When an AirTag comes within range of an Apple device in the Find My network, that device anonymously and securely relays the AirTag's location information to iCloud.
- Location Tracking: You can then use the Find My app on your own Apple device to see the approximate location of your AirTag on a map.

Limitations: Please note that AirTags rely on Bluetooth technology and the presence of Apple devices within the Find My network. If your AirTag is in an area with few Apple devices, its location may not be updated as frequently or accurately.

2. [Brian Chesky on How to Hire](https://x.com/benln/status/1852343618826129684)

Hiring philosophy

- Every potential hire is guilty until proven innocent
- **If your team can bring in people without your help, they aren't reaching high enough**
- You should spend as much time referencing as you do hiring

Interview tips

- Always ask two follow-up questions. **You never want to get the first answer, you always want the third answer.**
- Executives have more experience bullshitting you than you have experience detecting their BS
- Look for evidence of actual work. Start with the results and work backwards.
- For junior hires look at energy, passion, and learning agility

Reference checks

- Ask indirect questions, ex - separate from this topic, who's the best person you ever worked with?
- Make it safe for them to share. Everything is off the record, the more it's unattributed to them, the more honest they're going to be.
- **Get specifics. If they have no specifics, they maybe don't know they were really good**

Closing candidates

- The counter-intuitive approach is to try to talk them out of the job, builds trust by being upfront about how hard it will be and reduces natural skepticism from hard selling
- **Present the real challenges, that will turn off mediocre people but will turn on great people**
- Spend a lot of time with a candidate, tell them about your vision for them specifically Leverage networks to close, have people they trust call them
- Overpay the really good people, be willing to break normal compensation bands

Assessing performance

- If they're really scaling they're doing things they don't even need to be doing for six months
- If people aren't scaling, they're doing things today they should have done six months ago
- **People never hire people better than them, you have to be a talent magnet**
- Nine out of 10 times the trend never reverses when people stop scaling

## Comments

1. Champions obsess over fundamentals, not trophies.While others chase revenue and fancy titles, outliers focus on what they can control today: reading one more book, making one more phone call, and reviewing that email one final time. They know that excellence comes from perfecting the basics.Stop worrying about where the arrow lands. Master the art of drawing the bow.

2. Frustration is bargaining with reality, hoping it will change. Yelling at traffic doesn’t make it move faster. Rehearsing the same complaints about your spouse doesn’t change their behavior. Getting angry at the delayed flight doesn’t make it take off sooner. While you’re busy fighting what is, you’re blind to what could be. All the energy you put into arguing with reality comes at the expense of improving your situation. The mountain doesn’t care how much you yell at it, but you’ll find a path around it if you stop and look.

3. A mental model is a simplified explanation of how something works.
