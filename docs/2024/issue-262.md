1. [How does Terraform turn Code into Cloud?](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/150104440/how-does-terraform-turn-code-into-cloud)

There are multiple stages in a Terraform workflow:

- Write Infrastructure as Code
  - Define resources, providers, and configurations in Terraform configuration files.
  - Use variables, modules, and functions to make the code reusable and maintainable.
  - Integrate with Terraform community registries for ready-to-use modules.
- Terraform Plan
  - Preview the changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure by running “terraform plan”. It can be triggered as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
  - Terraform compares the desired state defined in the configuration file with the current state in the state file.
- Terraform Apply
  - Run “terraform apply” to create, update, or delete resources based on the plan.
  - Terraform makes API calls to the specified providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, etc) to provision the resources.
  - The state file is updated to reflect the new state of the infrastructure.
- Infrastructure Ready
  - Terraform state file acts as a single source of truth for the current state of the infrastructure.
  - State file enables version control and collaboration between team members for future changes.

2. [HTTP Status Code You Should Know](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/150104440/http-status-code-you-should-know)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37f0612c-440c-4d53-8c92-c77c8da9ff9c_1206x1166.jpeg)

The response codes for HTTP are divided into five categories:

- Informational (100-199)
- Success (200-299)
- Redirection (300-399)
- Client Error (400-499)
- Server Error (500-599)

4. [A Short Story That Will Make You a Better Leader/CEO](https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/1840082514842661347)

"Instead of sharing the vision & multi-year plan. Nat screen-shared and displayed a giant list of 100+ issues & complaints from customers. Today, we’re going to find one item on here, and fix it." -- Default to action is such a powerful mindset to adopt. Reminding ourselves that we serve our customers is even more important. It creates energy. It builds momentum. It brings the team together.

## Comments

1. Copying others doesn’t work because success without substance doesn’t last.

2. The path to differentiated results looks like madness to the masses. As the adage goes, if you do what everyone else does, you’ll get the same results everyone else gets. Extraordinary success requires misunderstood choices.

3. One of the best secrets of a happy life is the art of extracting comfort and sweetness from every circumstance. --Thomas Mitchell on finding the joy in everything

4. The opposite of sensitive is not brave. It’s not brave to refuse to pay attention, to refuse to notice, to refuse to feel and know and imagine. The opposite of sensitive is insensitive, and that’s no badge of honor. --Glennon Doyle on being sensitive
