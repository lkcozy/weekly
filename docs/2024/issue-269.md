1. [The Average Credit Card Debt in Every U.S. State (2024)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-the-average-credit-card-debt-in-every-u-s-state-2024/)

![](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/V2_Average-Credit-Card-Debt-by-State_WEB.jpg)

This map visualizes the average credit card debt held by households in each U.S. state and ranks the states where residents pay off the debt the fastest and slowest.

Richer state households—Connecticut, California, Washington—have higher costs of living and are carrying higher credit card balances. But they also manage to pay them off quickly with their larger incomes.

On the other hand, households in poorer states have below-average debt but it take closer to two years for them to pay it off.

3. [Venture Capital Deal Value by Region (1997 vs. 2023)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-venture-capital-deal-value-by-region-1997-vs-2023/)

![](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/VCLandscape_web.jpg)

This chart tracks how the share of total venture capital deal value changed around the world between 1997 and 2023.

A big reason for Asia’s growing share is China. It became the world’s manufacturer in the 2000s, eclipsed Japan as the second-largest economy in 2010, and has in recent years, seen a growing tech sector emerge.

2. [Elon Musk Explains the 5-Step Process He Tries to Implement in His Companies to Ensure Efficient Engineering](https://x.com/ElonClipsX/status/1783970554929619089)

Elon Musk explains the 5-step process he tries to implement in his companies to ensure efficient engineering:

- Make your requirements less dumb
- Try very hard to delete parts or processes
- Simplify/optimize
- Accelerate cycle time
- Automate

Challenging requirements may be the biggest lever to pull. Rarely do people take the time to understand if they can be removed or altered, only to realize they are of low value to the customer's needs.

3. [Building A Strong Ownership Culture in A Team](https://candost.blog/strong-ownership-culture-in-a-team/)

The article discusses the importance of creating an ownership culture within a team, sharing strategies for fostering accountability, learning, trust, individuality, and effectiveness.

- Leaders should aim to create a culture where team members take ownership, learn continuously, support each other, bring their authentic selves to work, and help deliver work effectively.
- Building this culture requires time, energy, delegation of responsibilities, and transparency.
- Implementing mechanisms like auto-vacation approval and expert decision-making empowers team members to take ownership over their work.
- Holding regular 1:1s helps build trust, exchange feedback, and create alignment.
- Setting clear goals with a focus on individual development, team objectives, and initiative ownership enhances accountability and motivation.
- Investing in expertise through mentorship, workshops, and practical learning opportunities is crucial for skill development.
- Delegating tasks to team members not only supports their growth but also allows leaders to focus on career-enhancing responsibilities.

The best leaders I’ve observed aim to create a culture where people

- take full ownership proactively (accountability + responsibility),
- learn (growth mindset),
- help each other (trust),
- bring themselves to work as they are, and
- help others deliver work effectively and efficiently.

- Leading Through 1:1s
  - My goal, as a leader, is to quickly set the stage for them to share those opinions freely and seek feedback as early as possible.
  - Adjusting the 1:1 strategy is the demanding part of leading because every person is unique and needs different levels of guidance in different stages of their careers.
- Implementing Mechanisms: Instead of preaching, implement mechanisms that will support ownership
- Transparency Means Context and Clarity: If they don’t know the mission, strategy, and roadmap, they can’t decide how to implement a feature or design a system.
- Setting Goals and Accountability Cadence: having individual goals, team goals, and, in their intersection, an initiative ownership mindset.
- Investing in Expertise: Defining individual and team goals helped us see where we lack the expertise.
- Delegation for Career Growth: once the team members work on these tasks, they also learn how to approach holistically, the complexity of work, the details of the feature/product, and how to manage stakeholders.

> You need to be resilient, relentless, and focused. Moreover, you have to have the people who want to put the work together with you. If you have a team of missionaries who just implement the code and don’t care about the rest, then you won’t get any results. Also, you have to have the right organization—not every organization is the best candidate to implement the whole system. However, if your organization develops its own product, then you can probably apply a few things from here to your team, if not the whole system.

4. [7 uncommon opinions after 10 years of product management](https://medium.com/@talraviv/7-uncommon-opinions-after-10-years-of-product-management-b3b5e69c255e)

As a product manager, the author challenges common beliefs such as the role of product manager, intelligence, metrics, attention-seeking, and specific processes in product management.

- The team as a whole is the product, not just the product manager.
- Smart people often build narratives from little data, leading to poor outcomes.
- Staying out of the spotlight can lead to greater success and productivity.
- Epics, stories, and metrics are not as important as team collaboration and shared context.
- Different companies have different approaches to product management, there is no one-size-fits-all approach.
- Focus on solving unique problems for customers instead of following trends from blog posts.

> The biggest wins (and most enjoyable periods of teamwork) worked like this: I dig up metrics/support tickets/interviews/everything → connect some dots → bring it to the team → they make me do more homework → they come up with brilliant ideas → we validate it together → hit the road.

> “Smart” people are good at painting incredible narratives from way too little data — and quickly. This is the fast lane to losing respect of your teammates and stakeholders — or worse, building crap no one wants.
> Instead of being intelligent, do your homework. **Doing your homework is the ultimate influence card. Doing your homework transcends rank and seniority and politics.**
> Listen to/attend more customer calls than anyone else. Take in more Amplitude charts than anyone else. Read more support tickets than anyone else. You get the picture.

> None of these artifacts(epics and stories ) really matter. What really matters is:
>
> - Your team knows the context and the evidence
> - You’ve mutually eliminated as much uncertainty as possible [as cheaply as possible]

## Comments

1. You have just six seconds to capture someone’s attention — but if you interest them, you earn another twenty to thirty seconds. Practically, this means you have about thirteen words to hook them and another thirty to forty to deliver your most compelling information. If your email exceeds 100 words, allocate your editing time wisely: dedicate 40% to perfecting the first sentence, 40% to refining the next 2-3 sentences, and just 20% to polishing the remainder.

2. The quietest person at a dinner party often leaves with a reputation for brilliance, while others talk themselves into corners. You see it in boardrooms too – the executive who tilts her head thoughtfully during presentations, somehow radiating wisdom without speaking a word. Even therapists build their practices more on artful silences than clever words.The wisest among us have learned that saying nothing often says everything. --The Power of the Perfect Pause

3. Theorizing is not nearly as effective as trying. --Charles F. Kettering on talking vs doing
