1. [What We Look for in a Resume](https://huyenchip.com/2023/01/24/what-we-look-for-in-a-candidate.html)

The article discusses the resume evaluation process at a startup, emphasizing the importance of demonstrated expertise, initiatives, persistence, unique perspectives, and impactful metrics.

- Demonstrated expertise through public channels (e.g., StackOverflow, open-source contributions, blog posts) is valued over keyword repetition, and candidates are encouraged to show how they acquired and used their skills.
- Initiatives and persistence are traits sought after in candidates to evaluate their ability to get things done.
- Unique perspectives and impactful contributions are preferred over common projects and meaningless metrics on resumes. The company seeks individuals who can bring fresh viewpoints to problem-solving.

Resume Tips

- One-page resumes are preferred but not mandatory; the focus is on concise, impactful information.
- For those with limited experience, transferable skills from other fields can be highlighted.
- Resumes should be tailored to showcase the candidate's best qualities relevant to the specific role.

This approach to hiring emphasizes substance over form, seeking candidates who can contribute unique value to a startup environment focused on solving challenging problems.

## Comments

1. Your company expects broader skills at the next level. For example, you are a great product leader but at the VP level they want finance skills or some other qualification. Look at others in the role you want and ask your manager what is needed to get there. Some people will ask: Should I leave my job and go elsewhere? Not until you know the real problem. You must identify and address the root cause of your stagnation. Otherwise, you will hit the same roadblocks in other jobs. --[Ethan Evans](https://x.com/EthanEvansVP/status/1869172337825992886)

2. Terence Tao captures well why writing down things we've done or learned can help increase memory recall and make the information we consume into knowledge we can apply. This is true for any discipline in life we choose to master. --[Write Down What Youâ€™ve Done](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/write-down-what-youve-done/)
