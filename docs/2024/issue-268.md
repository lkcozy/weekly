New research suggests that an ancient branch of the Nile River once flowed through the landscape, providing the waterway for transporting stone to build Egyptian pyramids and explaining their remote desert location.

- Data from satellites, sediment cores, and historical maps were used to uncover evidence of the ancient waterway.
- The existence of the river allowed workers to transport materials to construct the pyramids.
- The findings support the theory that Egyptians moved materials by water rather than using wheels.
- The study highlights the wetter climate and higher Nile volume in ancient Egypt.

## AI/ML

Code comments are important in software development, as they explain complex logic, document decision-making processes, and provide context for future developers.

The use of AI-powered coding assistants, such as Ollama, can enhance productivity by automating comment generation without compromising data privacy or becoming dependent on proprietary platforms.

Developers can use Ollama to interact with language models through simple commands, such as pulling models, running them, and generating comments for specific code blocks.

The article discusses how to create a VS Code extension that uses Ollama, a tool for running large language models (LLMs) locally, to automate code comment generation.

1. [Algorithms we develop software by](https://grantslatton.com/software-pathfinding#algorithms-we-develop-software-by?continueFlag=d7fcd898533ee846cb1db993ab480a29)

The article discusses various software development methodologies and heuristics for problem-solving in engineering.

- "Start over each day" method: Begin working on a feature at the start of the day, and if not finished by the end, delete it and start over the next day. This approach can lead to cleaner, higher-quality code.
- Writing code twice: Solve the problem, stash the code, then rewrite it entirely. This method often results in better quality code for only slightly more time investment.
- "Gun to your head" technique: Challenge engineers to come up with a solution in 24 hours instead of weeks. This helps break anchoring bias and often leads to more efficient solutions.
- Pathfinding in problem space: The author draws parallels between these heuristics and various pathfinding algorithms, suggesting that becoming a better engineer involves improving one's ability to find optimal solutions in problem space.

These methodologies aim to improve code quality, efficiency, and problem-solving skills in software development.

2. [How to not be a prioritization machine](https://productmanagers.substack.com/p/how-to-not-be-a-prioritization-machine)

The article discusses how product managers can avoid becoming mere "prioritization machines" and instead empower their teams to make decisions independently. Here are the key points:

- The author initially spent too much time answering prioritization questions, becoming a bottleneck for the team.
- Common prioritization frameworks like Cost vs. Impact or RICE (Reach, Impact, Cost, and Effort) are useful for task-level prioritization but less effective for roadmap-level decisions.
- To address this issue, the author created a team-wide prioritization guideline based on two factors:
  - Team goals
  - Stage of the team
- The guideline consists of 3 bullet points that align with the team's goals and current stage, allowing team members to make decisions independently.
- The prioritization guideline is updated every 3-6 months during quarterly roadmap planning, with regular updates on important developments.
- Benefits of this approach include:
  - Increased development velocity
  - More time for the PM to focus on long-term strategy
  - Team identification of previously unknown factors for planning
- Empowering the team to prioritize independently allows for faster progress and gives the PM time to focus on critical responsibilities and long-term product goal

These are divided into 6 broad categories

- Distributed Computing
  - Distributed message queues facilitate async communication and decouple services.
  - Distributed caching improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
  - A Distributed task scheduler manages and coordinates the execution of tasks
- Scalability and Performance
  - Scaling services help adjust the capacity of services to handle changes in demand
  - CDNs serve content from geographically closer locations to improve performance and reduce latency.
  - Consistent hashing minimizes the remapping of keys when nodes are added or removed
- Service Management
  - Service discovery enables services to find and communicate with each other without hard-coding network locations
- Networking and Communication
  - DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses

4. [General Thinking Tools | Thought Experiment](https://geni.us/7NiWm)

Thought experiments are the sandbox of the mind, a place where we can play with ideas without constraints. They’re a way of exploring the implications of our theories, of testing the boundaries of our understanding. They offer a powerful tool for clarifying our thinking, revealing hidden assumptions, and showing us unintended consequences.

The power of thought experiments lies in their ability to create a simplified model of reality where we can test our ideas. In the real world, there are always confounding factors, messy details that obscure the core principles at work. However, in a thought experiment, we can strip away the noise and focus on the essence of the problem.

Thought experiments remind us that some of the most profound insights and innovations start with a simple question: What if?

## Comments

1. It’s true that determining the actual problem takes time, but it’s far quicker than solving the wrong one and starting over.

2. Smart people are uniquely vulnerable to mistaking complexity for insight. An executive writes a ten-page memo that could be one. An engineer builds an intricate system when a simple one would perform better at half the cost. The consultant mesmerizes clients with frameworks that conceal rather than reveal. We attach prestige to what mystifies us. Complexity intoxicates both the creator and audience, drugging us with the illusion of wisdom. Mastery isn’t making the simple complex—it’s finding the elegant simplicity that cuts through the complexity.

3. The difference between greatness and mediocrity isn’t in the spectacular moments but rather in avoiding critical errors. Excellence isn’t about occasional brilliance – it’s about consistent execution.

4. I never feared about my skills because I put in the work. Work ethic eliminates fear. So you if you do the work, what are you fearing? You know what you’re capable of and what you’re not. --Michael Jordan’s response when asked if a fear of failure motivated him

5. Learn from fields very different from your own. They each have ways of thinking that can be useful at surprising times. Just learning to think like an anthropologist, a psychologist, and a philosopher will beneficially stretch your mind. --David Chapman on why learning mental models is a good idea
