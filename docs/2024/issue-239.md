Increased urban tree coverage is crucial in reducing heat-related deaths and energy consumption in neighborhoods, especially in poorer areas, as shown by a recent study analyzing the impact of trees on urban environments across the United States.

- Urban areas with fewer trees experience higher temperatures, leading to increased energy consumption and heat-related fatalities.
- Planting more trees in urban areas can result in numerous health and economic benefits, particularly in neighborhoods with higher population density and lower income.
- Focusing on tree planting in poorer, densely populated urban neighborhoods can lead to significant reductions in energy consumption, improved health, and economic gains.

## Tool

1. [Windows](https://github.com/marticliment/WingetUI)

![](https://img.hellogithub.com/i/UMHE3YTn94JxGBf_1714047524.png)

The main goal of this project is to create an intuitive GUI for the most common CLI package managers for Windows 10 and Windows 11, such as Winget, Scoop, Chocolatey, Pip, Npm, .NET Tool and PowerShell Gallery. With this app, you can easily download, install, update, and uninstall any software published on the supported package managers — and much more!

2. [⌘K](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk)

![](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk/raw/main/website/public/og.png)

⌘K is a command menu React component that can also be used as an accessible combobox. You render items, it filters and sorts them automatically. ⌘K supports a fully composable API How?, so you can wrap items in other components or even as static JSX.

2. [Things Every Developer Should Know: Concurrency is NOT parallelism](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/143744904/things-every-developer-should-know-concurrency-is-not-parallelism)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6fb7f481-5547-4ce0-aeee-d685789187b2_1280x1664.gif)

Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once." This distinction emphasizes that concurrency is more about the design of a program, while parallelism is about the execution.

Parallelism is physical simultaneous execution, while concurrency is logical simultaneous execution. Parallelism requires hardware to support multiple processing units, while concurrency can be achieved in single-processor systems with fast switching

- Concurrency is about dealing with multiple things at once. It involves structuring a program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, where the tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, but not necessarily at the same instant.
- Parallelism, on the other hand, refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple computations. It is the technique of running two or more tasks or computations at the same time, utilizing multiple processors or cores within a computer to perform several operations concurrently.

3. [What is DevSecOps?](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/143977109/what-is-devsecops)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48869994-6149-4718-8412-87b47200bff8_1280x1664.gif)

The term "DevSecOps" represents the convergence of Development (Dev), Security (Sec), and Operations (Ops) practices, emphasizing the importance of security throughout the software development lifecycle.

4. [How Perplexity builds product](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-perplexity-builds-product)

The article discusses Perplexity, a rapidly growing AI company, and provides insights into their product development process, focusing on AI-first approaches, using small teams, minimal managers, and the importance of technical product managers.

- Perplexity relies heavily on AI for various aspects of company-building, including product development and decision-making. Employees are encouraged to ask AI before bothering colleagues.
- The company operates with small teams, typically consisting of two to three people, and minimal managers, prioritizing self-driven ICs, and **actively avoid hiring people who are strongest at guiding other people’s work**.
- The company's approach to structuring teams and projects involves minimizing coordination costs through parallelization and decentralized decision-making.
- Perplexity emphasizes the importance of technical product managers or engineer with a focus on taste in making qualitative decisions around use cases.
- The article highlights the importance of flexibility, trust, and a culture of setting clear priorities and goals within the organization.

5. [How to sharpen your analytical thinking—even if you’re "not a numbers person"](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/analytical-thinking)

In this article, Wes discusses the importance of developing analytical skills, especially in relation to business and decision-making.

- Analytical skills are essential for making informed decisions and gaining a competitive edge.
- Analytical thinking doesn't just involve numbers, but also skepticism, curiosity, logical reasoning, and hypothesis validation.
- Concepts such as patterns, absolute numbers, percentages, variances, profit margins, incentives, and ranges are crucial in developing an analytical mindset.
- Asking questions to poke holes in one's own logic and understanding the boundaries of ideas can lead to better decision-making.

The benefit of developing an analytical mindset is two-fold:

- It will help you make more informed decisions
- It will give you a competitive edge among your peers

- Patterns & pattern breaks： See the norm, what sticks out, what needs a second look.
  - What’s “normal” around here?
  - What sticks out?
  - Why is it sticking out?
  - How much does it stick out compared to everything else?
- Absolute numbers & percentages
  - If you only look at absolute numbers, big numbers seem good and small numbers seem bad.
  - If you look at percentages, you’ll see the relationship between the parts and the whole.
- Variance：it is about change: change from the baseline and changes over time.
  - Was the variance in line with our projections or industry’s growth—or did we outpace or lag comparatively?
- Consider incentives: Be mindful of cherry-picked data points.
  - What are the incentives of each party?
  - How do they benefit from you believing this narrative?
  - Where might they be cherry-picking data points to show a specific story?
- Investigate why—and what to do about it: Figure out the cause. Figure out the impact. Keep validating or invalidating your hypothesis until you get closer to the truth.
  - Why is this happening?
  - What's the impact?
  - What should we do about it?
- Poke holes in your own logic：By understanding the boundaries of an idea, you can make better decisions about how something applies to your situation.
  - What are reasons not do this?
  - What might I be wrong about?
  - What might I be missing?
  - What are the boundaries of this idea?

## Comments

1. Competence is how good when you are when there is something to gain. Character is how good you are when there is nothing to gain. People will reward you for your competence. But people will only love you for your character. --[Mark Manson](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-5-2024/)

2. When we reach an impasse at any point in the creative process, it can be helpful to step away from the project to create space and allow a solution to appear. --Rick Rubin

3. The more comfortable you are with yourself, the less you need the approval of others.

4. The most common response when we're scared is avoidance. The longer we wait, the greater the fear. Action reduces fear.

5. By observing how something fails, you can learn a lot about where a team or organisation is. The specific case does not matter; you are interested in the patterns of failure. Now you know where to start work. I call this technique Fix the Next One. --[Seek First to Understand](https://dannorth.net/seek-first-to-understand/)
