> TEU: twenty-foot equivalent unit, a general unit of cargo capacity

In 2024, nine of the world’s 10 busiest ports are located in Asia, underscoring the eastward shift in global trade flows.

Due to supply chain shifts and deeper integration, intraregional trade within Asia has grown significantly. In the 1990s, over 70% of Asian exports by value went beyond the region, with containers being shipped back mostly empty. By comparison, roughly 60% of exports in Asia are traded within the region today.

1. [Navigating Unsolicited Advice in the Workplace](https://hbr.org/2024/07/when-a-coworker-keeps-giving-you-unsolicited-advice)

Unsolicited advice, though often well-intentioned, can feel intrusive and even undermine your confidence at work. If a colleague frequently offers advice you didn't ask them for, how can you set respectful boundaries? Here's how to balance openness to feedback with trust in your own expertise.

Frame your idea as a solution, not a discussion. Instead of saying, "I'm thinking about trying X," say, "I've decided to do X because of Y and Z benefits." This communicates that you're sharing information, not seeking feedback or opening a collaborative process.

Show existing support. Mention any positive results or support. Mention any possible results or support from higher-ups to signal that your idea has already been validated.

Combine a compliment with a boundary. Regain control of the conversation with phrases like, "I appreciate your input, but I need to stick to the current plan to meet our deadlines." Pair this with a nonverbal cue, like raising your hand briefly to indicate a pause.

Directly ask for what you need. Be clear about the type of feedback you are open to. For example, "I value your insight. For now, I'm specifically looking for feedback on how to improve this idea, rather than exploring alternative options.

2. [Take a More Strategic Approach to Work...Every Day](https://hbr.org/2024/07/6-ways-to-bring-strategy-into-your-work-every-day)

Being strategic is an essential leadership skill. But strategies are notoriously hard to design and deliver. The key to overcoming the organizational and personal obstacles that get in the way? Make small decisions about where to focus and what to do throughout your day. They may feel inconsequential, but their impacts accumulate. Try these six strategies for incorporating strategic thinking into your daily work.

Identify key actions. Allocate time each day to activities that significantly contribute to your overall strategy. Prioritize high-impact tasks and delegate or eliminate less critical ones.

Address major problems. Tack the biggest challenges first. Reframe problems as opportunites to grow-and consider how solving them aligns with your strategiec goals.

Explore choices. In every interaction with your colleagues, think about the different ways you could make progress toward your goals. Consider your role, what sets you apart from others, and your desired impact, and look out for learning opportunities in the moment.

Master necessary skills. Continue to invest in your growth and development. Learn from past efforts, seek advice from trusted coworkers. Learn from past efforts, seek advice from trusted coworkers, and look to high-performing peers for inspiration.

Create alignment. Strive to align your strategic decisions with the needs of all stakeholders-yourself included! Reframe situations to find innovative ways to benefit both you and your organization's goals.

Assemble resources. Ensure you have the physical, mental, and relational resources you need to do your best work. Prioritize health, supportive relationships, and a productive work environment.

- Peer-to-Peer: involves direction communication between two components without the need for a central coordinator
- API Gateway: acts as a single entry point for all clinet requests to the backend services of an application
- Pub-Sub: decouples the producers of messages (publishers) from the consumers of messages (subscribers) through a message broker
- Request-Response: a client sends a request to a server and waits for a response
- Event Sourcing: involves storing the state changes of an application as a sequence of events
- ETL (Extract, transform, load): is a data integration pattern used to gather data from multiple sources, transform it into a structured format, and load it into a destination database
- Batching: involves accumulating data over a period or until a certain threshold is met before processing it as a single group
- Streaming Processing: allows for continuous ingestion, processing, and analysis of data streams in real-time
- Orchestration: involves a central coordinator managing the interactions between distributed components or services to achieve a workflow or business process.

## Comments

1. Being direct, clear, and concise is how a healthy discussion starts on almost all levels. Very rarely people want to talk about all the details all the time. It's draining, and often, one side needs more context to fully understand or provide feedback on the details. They often want to get the overview and move forward, and for specific areas, they might want to delve deeper to ask more questions and better understand the situation. When talking with executives, this goes to the extreme.--[The One Key to Dealing With Senior Executives: Answer the Question!](https://kellblog.com/2012/01/17/the-one-key-to-dealing-with-senior-executives-answer-the-question/)

2. Programmers have a pavlovian engineering response. Pose them a problem and they'll start trying to solve it. --[Start Presentations on the Second Slide](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/start-presentations-on-the-second)

3. There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket-safe, dark, motionless, airless - it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation.

4. You don't need intensity; you need more consistency. Intensity impresses; consistency transforms.

5. We want the outcome, but we need the journey. A startup isn't about the money-raising headline; it's loving the grind when everyone else is out having fun. Health isn't about the gym selfie; it's the daily decision to train, even when you don't feel like it. Financial independence isn't quitting your job; it's the thousand small "nos" that let you say a big "yes" to your future. Falling in love with outcomes doesn't move you forward. Falling in love with the process does.

6. It can be hard to appreciate just how much the world will give you what you want after you stop waiting for it to give you what you deserve. Stop waiting for the world to recognize your potential; start giving the world something positive. Don't wait for a friend's apology; reach out and reconnect. Instead of waiting for the perfect partner, become that partner. Rather than waiting for motivation to exercise, start small and build momentum. Don't complain about something; change it. Life rewards actions.

7. Putting yourself around people with high agency is one of the most energizing things for your career and personal growth. They look at everything as an opportunity, seek insights to create leverage, and know how to build momentum to get the result.
