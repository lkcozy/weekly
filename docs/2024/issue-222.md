1. [This Is the Person Selling Your Product: What I Wish Someone Had Told Me About Sales When I Was Starting My Career in Tech](https://blog.staysaasy.com/p/this-is-the-person-selling-your-product)

A must-read post for non-sales reps trying to understand what sales is all about and the challenges around it. If you're a software engineer or a product manager, read it twice.

It highlights the various skills and expertise that sales reps bring to the table, including project management, presentation skills, and deal structuring.

Great salespeople can largely sell anything – the key skills of sales (e.g. empathy, customer discovery, and general ability to keep a group organized) do transfer to an extent. But the place where the person selling your product can really shine is when they have a differentiated offering: One that is obviously more powerful, easier to use, cheaper, or easier to support than others. With a differentiated offering, the person selling your product can focus on all of the repeatable skills that will help your product fly off the shelves.

2. [The courage to imagine other failures](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2023/12/22/the-courage-to-imagine-other-failures/)

This is a powerful mindset when thinking about risk management and how to prioritize i.

The article discusses the dilemma of whether to prioritize follow-up work after an incident or focus on preventative work for future incidents in order to improve reliability in a software service company.

It is important to consider the potential risks and consequences of future incidents and prioritize preventative work accordingly.

Perfect information about future consequences is not available, and decision-making should be based on judgment and consideration of known risks.

## Comments

1. Thinking long-term is the biggest overlooked advantage hidden in plain sight.

2. It can be difficult to appreciate just how much avoiding the standard ways of failing dramatically increases the odds of success.
   --[Shane](https://fs.blog/brain-food/january-7-2024/)

3. New goals don't deliver new results. New lifestyles do. And a lifestyle is a process, not an outcome. For this reason, all of your energy should go into building better habits, not chasing better results.
