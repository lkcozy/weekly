The article discusses the author's experience of developing a mobile app for his toddler, inspired by her fascination with airplanes, focusing on late-stage user testing with the toddler and the challenges faced in creating a radar app that displays nearby flights on a map.

The app focuses on maintaining orientation, showing aircraft sizes relative to their altitude, and offering a fun, retro kid's toy feel.

The author leveraged the Core Location API, the OpenSky Network API for flight data, and SwiftUI for building the app.

The app displays aircraft icons on a map, adjusts their sizes based on altitude, and rotates them facing the correct direction using trigonometry.

- Diagnosis: you must identify the challenge and simplify it to its most critical aspects
- Guiding policy: you choose an overarching approach of you'll deal with the challenge
- A set of coherent actions: you decide on a series of actions you'll take to implement your policy

## Comments

1. If you really want to be great at something, you have to truly care about it. If you want to be great in a particular area, you have to obsess over it. A lot of people say they want to be great, but they're not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve greatness. They have other concerns, and they spread themselves out.

Greatness isn't easy to achieve. It requires a lot of time, a lot of sacrifices. It requires a lot of tough choices. It requires your loved ones to sacrifice, too. So you have to haven an understanding circle of family and friends. People don't always understand just how much effort from how many people goes into one person chasing a dream to be great. There's a fine balance between obsessing about your craft and being there for your family.

It's akin to walking a tightrope. Your legs are shaky, and you're trying to find your center. Whenever you lean too far in one direction, you correct your course and end up over leaning in the other direction. So you correct by learning the other way again. That's the dance. You can't achieve greatness by walking a straight line. --Kobe Bryant

2. It's easier to get a smart person to do something hard than to get them to do something easy that doesn't matter.

3. When you know what needs to be done, inaction increases stress. You feel a lot less stress when you do the things within your control that move you closer to your objective. Action reduces stress.

4. a lack of routine cause more problems than poor choices. Routines turn desired behavior into default behavior.

5. Be quiet, work hard, and stay healthy. It's not ambition or skill that is going to set you apart but sanity.

6. Minimum Buyable Product > Minimum Viable Product
