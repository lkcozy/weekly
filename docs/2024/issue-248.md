```python
import os
class Greeter:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hi")

def hello_world():
    message = "Hello, world!"
    greeter = Greeter()
    func_name = "greet"
    greet_func = getattr(greeter, func_name)
    greet_func()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()

# $ vulture dead_code.py
# dead_code.py:1: unused import 'os' (90% confidence)
# dead_code.py:4: unused function 'greet' (60% confidence)
# dead_code.py:8: unused variable 'message' (60% confidence)
```

Vulture finds unused code in Python programs. This is useful for cleaning up and finding errors in large code bases. If you run Vulture on both your library and test suite you can find untested code.

## Resources

1. [Empathy with boundaries](https://newsletter.canopy.is/p/empathy-with-boundaries)

The article explores how leaders can balance being empathetic with maintaining boundaries in order to care for both their team and themselves.

- **All Problems ≠ Your Problems**. Leaders need to remember that their job is to help their team solve problems, not to solve the problems themselves.
  - Resist immediately rolling up your sleeves and trying to solve the problem for them.
    - What do you see as the underlying root cause of the problem?
    - How do you know you will have been successful in resolving this issue?
    - What are some ideas you have to resolve this? What’s the most likely outcome based on those ideas?
  - Give pointers for how they can approach bringing problems to you in the future. Share forward-looking feedback, such as:
    - I really appreciate you bringing this concern to my attention. In order to make sure we can resolve things like this as quickly as possible in the future, I think it’d be super helpful to have you do further research and propose a few solutions. That way, our time can be more focused on discerning a framework for the best path forward, rather than brainstorming solutions.
- **Care is only helpful if it is mutual**, so leaders must prioritize caring for themselves first in order to effectively care for their team.
  - Be honest about your ability to show up fully – and share that openly. Then, suggest alternative ways for your team to feel supported. For example:
    - Hey [insert name], I'm so grateful that you are willing to share so openly + honestly with me. Right now, I'm not in a great space to be able to be a sounding board for you because, honestly, I'm a bit burnt out. Would you consider writing up your thoughts + sharing them with me asynchronously so I able to read them when I have a bit more bandwidth? I really don't want your voice to be silenced, and I think if we kept talking today, I would unintentionally be tuning you out.

2. [Inversion - Mental Model](https://read.perspectiveship.com/p/inversion)

Inversion thinking can be applied in many areas - doing post-mortems (analyzing what can go wrong), figuring out how to launch a new product, and more. Preventing stupid mistakes is often more impactful than trying to aim doing all the right things. It might not be enough to make you world-class, but it will put you in the top 1%.

- Inversion involves looking at a problem from the opposite perspective to identify what should be avoided.
- Avoiding obvious mistakes is more important than seeking perfection.
- Inversion helps in making better decisions, especially in groups, to align and address cognitive biases.

Here are more examples of inversion:

- Instead of thinking of how to make money, think of how to lose money.
- Instead of thinking of how to keep users engaged, think of how to push them away.
- Instead of thinking of how to get stronger, think of how to get weaker.

The most natural style of thinking is forward thinking - we jump to possible solutions and ideas on how to solve a given problem. We plan our actions, thinking about what to do next. Thanks to inversion we can see the problem from a different angle which helps us avoid stupidity.

The video "How to Be a Sharper Operator" by Wes Kao offers valuable insights on becoming a more effective professional. By implementing the following strategies, professionals can become sharper operators, enhancing their effectiveness in the workplace and fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.

### Why Deceivingly Basic Topics and Nuances Matter

Wes Kao expresses a particular interest in topics that appear simple on the surface but contain significant depth when explored further. Here's why she finds these topics fascinating:

- Depth in Simplicity
  - Basic concepts often have layers of complexity that are not immediately apparent
  - Mastering the fundamentals can lead to exponential growth in more advanced areas
- Widespread Applicability
  - "Basic" topics often have broad applications across various fields and industries
  - Understanding these topics deeply can provide a competitive advantage in many situations
- Nuances Make the Difference
  - They often distinguish between average and exceptional performance
  - Understanding nuances allows for more precise and effective application of concepts
  - It enables professionals to communicate complex ideas more effectively to diverse audiences
  - Nuances help in adapting strategies to specific contexts and situations
  - Develop a deeper understanding of their field. Improve their problem-solving skills. Enhance their ability to innovate and think creatively.
- Continuous Learning and Improvement
  - Revisiting fundamental topics with a focus on nuances promotes continuous learning
  - It encourages professionals to question assumptions and refine their understanding

### Rigorous Thinking as a Force Multiplier

Wes Kao emphasizes that rigorous thinking is a crucial skill that can significantly enhance one's professional performance. She explains that cultivating a culture of rigorous thinking involves:

- Encouraging team members to question assumptions
- Promoting critical analysis of ideas and proposals
- Fostering an environment where challenging the status quo is welcomed

People often struggle with rigorous thinking due to:

- Fear of appearing confrontational or negative
- Lack of practice in structured thinking
- Tendency to accept ideas without thorough examination

### Managing Up and BLUF Communication

Kao advocates for effective upward management and the use of "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) communication. This approach involves:

- Presenting the most important information first
- Clearly stating the purpose and expected outcome of communications
- Structuring messages to respect the recipient's time and attention

### Getting the Right Level of Feedback

- Being specific about the type of feedback needed
- Providing context and background information
- Asking targeted questions to guide the feedback process

### Vulnerability vs Perception Management

Kao discusses the balance between showing vulnerability and managing perceptions in the workplace. She advises:

- Being authentic while maintaining professionalism
- Sharing challenges when appropriate, but also demonstrating problem-solving skills
- Building trust through controlled vulnerability without compromising leadership image

### Managing Others: Expectations and Autonomy

When managing others, Kao emphasizes the importance of:

- Setting clear expectations from the outset
- Providing a framework for success while allowing for individual approaches
- Inspiring autonomy by delegating meaningful tasks and trusting team members
- Encouraging ownership by giving credit and recognizing contributions

## Comments

1. Diversity isn’t about appearances but rather different perspectives shaped by experience
   --[The Stormtrooper Problem](https://fs.blog/stormtrooper-problem/)

2. The real value in setting goals is not in their achievement. The acquisition of the things you want is strictly secondary. The major reason for setting goals is to compel you to become the person it takes to achieve them. --[7 Strategies for Wealth and Happiness](https://amzn.to/4csJvWl)

3. If you can’t be a fan, don’t be a critic.

4. It can be difficult to appreciate how much avoiding the standard ways of failing dramatically increases the odds of success.

5. We often fixate on the visible and exciting, overlooking that most success comes from consistently doing the mundane, unglamorous work that few notice.

The 98/2 Rule: people spend 98% of their time talking about flashy things that contribute only 2% to the results, while overlooking the fact that 98% of the results come from consistently doing the boring basics that few notice.

Ask yourself: Does the attention you give to something truly reflect its true importance?

6. It isn’t what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about.

7. It’s important for leaders to recognise that their job first and foremost is to maximise the delivery of value NOT maximising the utilisation of resources.

8. Decide, before you start, that you’re going to change three things about what you do all day at work. Then, as you’re reading, find the three things and do it. The goal of the reading, then, isn’t to persuade you to change, it’s to help you choose what to change. --[How to Read a Business Book](https://seths.blog/2008/05/how-to-read-a-b/)

9. Employees can prepare for promotion by prioritizing the right work at the right time and effectively communicating their work outcomes and impact on the business or customers. --[Breaking Down ‘Executive Presence’…and How to Develop It, Too](https://code.likeagirl.io/breaking-down-executive-presence-and-how-to-develop-it-too-567d4a23029b)

10. Maybe that failure you just experienced is your starting line

11. True mastery is shown by simplifying the complex, not complicating the simple.
