> Map of 468 cities showing that urban areas closer to the equator have lower cooling capacity from urban green spaces compared to cities farther from equator. This pattern highlights a significant inequality, with cities in the Global North having about 1.5 times the cooling capacity of those in the Global South.

The study found that cities in the Global South, which generally include countries in Latin America, South America, Africa, and parts of Asia, are at higher risk of experiencing heat stress due to:

- Overall warmer climates
- Higher population density
- Higher population growth rates

Urban Vegetation Cooling Benefits

Urban green spaces, such as parks and forests, can help reduce heat stress through: Providing shade and Transpirational cooling

The study revealed significant disparities in urban vegetation cooling benefits:

- Cities at lower latitudes experienced less benefit from urban vegetation cooling compared to those at higher latitudes.
- Cities in the Global South have approximately 70% of the cooling capacity of those in the Global North (2.5°C vs. 3.6°C on average)
- The average person in Global South cities benefits less from this cooling (2.2°C vs. 3.4°C).

> CARES stands for Communicate, Accountability, Roadmap, Execution, and Support.

Helping low-performing team members improve their motivation and skills is a challenging task for managers, but the CARES framework provides a structured process to transform them into key contributors.

- The Situational Leadership Framework helps managers adapt their approach based on team members' skill levels and motivation.
- Patience, clear communication, and ongoing support are key to guiding low-performing employees to reach their full potential.

Step 1: Communicate

As a manager, you must address performance issues early and clearly, rather than waiting for year-end reviews.

- Document Performance Issues: Before discussing performance, gather evidence of multiple instances over at least six months. Document the expected results, actual results, and how they relate to performance issues.
- Engage in Dialogue: In the meeting, listen to the team member’s perspective. It’s crucial to have a two-way conversation.
- Summarize and Share: After the discussion, send a summary email or document outlining the issues, agreements, and next steps. This sets a clear tone for the process.

What to Say: “Hi [Team Member], I wanted to discuss your recent performance. Over the past few months, there have been several instances where your work hasn’t met expectations, such as [specific examples]. I’d like to understand your perspective on these issues and work together on a plan to improve.”

Step 2: Accountability

Define the specific responsibilities the team member must fulfill to meet their goals.

- Define Responsibilities: Outline clear and specific tasks, such as requirement clarification, timely task completion, and regular updates.
- Agree on Accountability: Ensure the team member understands and agrees to these responsibilities. Adjust if there is any disagreement.
- Document Accountability: Share a written record of the agreed-upon responsibilities.
- What to Say: “Let’s clarify your responsibilities. For example, you’ll need to provide requirement clarifications before starting any coding, ensure timely completion of tasks, and regularly update me on any dependencies or issues. Do you agree with these expectations?”

Step 3: Roadmap

Create a detailed roadmap to guide the team member’s improvement journey. The roadmap should include granular tasks and milestones.

- Detail Tasks and Milestones: Break down tasks into manageable steps with clear milestones.
- Set a Timeline: The roadmap should span at least three months to allow for meaningful progress.
- Consider Role Adjustments: If needed, discuss potential role changes within the organization for a better fit.
- What to Say: “To help you improve, we’ll create a roadmap with specific tasks and milestones. For the next three months, your milestones will include completing project documentation and attending relevant training sessions. We’ll review your progress regularly to ensure you’re on track.”

Step 4: Execution

With the roadmap in place, the next step is execution. The team member begins working on the agreed tasks while the manager monitors progress.

- Track Progress: Monitor the completion of tasks and milestones.
- Evaluate Regularly: Conduct evaluations at each milestone based on predefined criteria.
- Adjust as Needed: Make necessary adjustments based on progress and feedback.
- What to Say: “Now that we have our roadmap, let’s start working on these tasks. We’ll review each milestone together to ensure you’re progressing as expected. If you encounter any issues, let me know immediately so we can address them.”

Step 5: Support

- Provide ongoing support throughout the execution phase. Your involvement and encouragement are crucial for the team member’s success.
- Offer Regular Feedback: Give constructive feedback and course-correct as necessary.
- Provide Training: Arrange small training sessions if needed.
  Maintain Open Communication: Conduct regular one-on-ones to discuss progress and challenges.
- What to Say: “I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. We’ll have regular check-ins to discuss your progress and any challenges you might face. Remember, this is a collaborative effort, and your improvement is my priority.”

2. [Lean Architecture: A Better Way to Apply and Teach Software Design](https://medium.com/@aboutcoding/lean-architecture-7393fb48e13a)

A cost effective solution is a solution that is easy to maintain. We are talking about code that is easy to understand, easy to test, it enables cooperation and in general it is easy to change and evolve.

Evolution is really important. Stakeholders evolve, their problems evolve and thus your solution should be able to evolve along. Being able to evolve along shouldn’t be a huge cost. That is why I would like to see Lean Architecture more as a methodology / mindset rather than an end state.

It should be a process of intermediate states only. The process only stops when change stops. It’s a constant search for a code solution that solves the current problems and at the same time keeps the amount of design patterns, principles and what not to the bare minimum.

We keep the following question in mind: How much design do we need to implement right now to keep the codebase maintainable?

## Comments

1. Often the most helpful thing you can do for people is to push them to be more ambitious or encourage them to hold themselves to a higher standard.

2. People often won't directly tell you what they want, and you need to discern their intentions through careful observation.

3. Profitable growth is growth with a purpose. My idea of purposeful growth is one that attempts to account for an "all hands on deck" approach to solving problems, rather than a "get out of my way" mentality," "Define yourself by what you contribute, not what you contest.

4. Andrej Karpathy's takeaways on learning are spot on: execute a project, capture learning in my own words, and compare to my younger self. Thinking about learning from the perspective of intensity helps me understand how important it is to really understand and apply what I learned.
