The article discusses the importance of satellite imagery options and remote sensing technology in analyzing earth materials, features, and atmospheric conditions.

- Different earth features have unique spectral signatures based on how they interact with light at different wavelengths.
- The tool allows users to explore spectral profiles of materials, objects, and features acquired by satellite imagery.
- The tool has been recently updated with improved user interfaces and analysis functions, allowing users to compare different spectral signatures and sensor information for satellites.

## AI/ML

Use API to call the music generation AI of suno.ai, and easily integrate it into agents like GPTs.

2. [Suno API](https://github.com/SunoApi/SunoApi)

This is an unofficial Suno API client based on Python and Streamlit currently supports functions such as generating music and obtaining music information.

3. [x-crawl](https://github.com/coder-hxl/x-crawl)

x-crawl is a flexible Node.js AI-assisted crawler library. Flexible usage and powerful AI assistance functions make crawler work more efficient, intelligent and convenient.

It consists of two parts:

- Crawler: It consists of a crawler API and various functions that can work normally even without relying on AI.
- AI: Currently based on the large AI model provided by OpenAI, AI simplifies many tedious operations.

## Tool

1. [ModernError](https://github.com/ehmicky/modern-errors)

Create error classes, wrap or aggregate errors, or use one of several plugins to do things like print bug reporting info, print stack traces, and more.

2. [stokado](https://github.com/KID-joker/stokado)

```js
import { createProxyStorage } from "stokado";
const storage = createProxyStorage(localStorage);
storage.getItem("test");
```

stokado can proxy objects of any storage-like, providing getter/setter syntax sugars, serialization, subscription listening, expiration setting, one-time value retrieval.

Jack Altman interviews his brother Sam Altman on how to build an impactful career, discussing topics such as work-life balance, taking risks, working with others, finding inspiration, and making internal decisions.

- Look for the intersection of what you're good at, what you enjoy, and what creates value for the world to have an impact.
- Find your tribe and work with like-minded individuals in your field.
- Personal conviction, focus, personal connections, and self-belief are crucial for achieving big things.
- Early in your career, working hard and improving consistently leads to compounding benefits.
- Taking risks is easier when you're young and unknown, and not taking risks can lead to regret.
- Have strong opinions but be flexible on details, while also being open to new data.
- Identify where you can make the biggest impact and have the courage to take risks in that area.

2. [You can not appreciate what you do not understand](https://stan.bar/appreciate/)

The article discusses the importance of understanding and appreciating things that might initially seem unappealing, urging readers to adopt a different attitude to learn and grow.

- Lack of understanding leads to dismissing things as impractical or uninteresting.
- Appreciating something requires learning and empathy.
- By appreciating more, one can experience the world with higher intensity and find new interests.
- Learning and practicing different skills can help one understand and appreciate diverse aspects of life.

3. [The Dead Sea effect](https://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/)

Large organizations struggle with IT development due to the "Dead Sea effect", where talented IT engineers are more likely to leave due to workplace problems, while less talented engineers remain and entrench themselves in critical systems.

Talented engineers leave due to workplace problems and other job opportunities, while less talented engineers stay due to job security.

The effect is self-reinforcing, making it difficult for organizations to attract and retain talented IT engineers.

4. [Measuring Developer Productivity via Humans](https://martinfowler.com/articles/measuring-developer-productivity-humans.html)

Many tech companies struggle with measuring the productivity of their engineering teams using quantitative metrics, leading to the need for a shift towards qualitative metrics derived from human insights.

- Qualitative metrics focus on capturing insights from developers themselves rather than basic measures of speed and output.
- Qualitative metrics include attitudinal and behavioral measurements, providing a more comprehensive understanding of developer productivity.
- Advocating for qualitative metrics involves overcoming skepticism about their reliability and usefulness, emphasizing their complementarity with quantitative metrics.

5. [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/)

One evening a developer refactored a colleague's code into a cleaner version to remove duplication and improve readability. The next morning, the developer was asked to revert the changes by their boss, leading to a deeper reflection on the notion of "clean code".

- Obsessing over "clean code" and removing duplication is a common phase for developers, driven by the desire for measurable standards and professional pride.
- Creating abstractions and removing duplication can be tempting, but it may not always lead to better code and can hinder adaptability to changing requirements.
- Effective collaboration within a team involves communication and trust, rather than unilaterally rewriting code without input from colleagues.

## Comments

1. Problems arise when we start compromising our own standards, those we have set for ourselves, in order to earn the admiration of others. Problems come when we choose to focus on what others think and see versus reality. --[The Inner Scorecard](https://fs.blog/the-inner-scorecard/)

2. The way people solve problems is first by having an enormous amount of commonsense knowledge, like maybe 50 million little anecdotes or entries, and then having some unknown system for finding among those 50 million old stories the 5 or 10 that seem most relevant to the situation. This is reasoning by analogy. --Marvin Minsky

3. What matters isn’t being applauded when you arrive—for that is common—but being missed when you leave. --Baltasar Gracián

4. Thinking is all about the ability to look at complex situations and strip away things that don’t count—the ability to filter out situations and find what’s at their core. — Paraphrasing Douglas Hofstadters

5. What every human being wants and needs:

- To be part of something larger than themselves
- To be paid attention to
- To be listened to
- To be respected
- To be loved
- To matter

7. The beginner plays within the boundaries.The competent explore the boundaries.The master knows when to ignore them.

8. I like to avoid dealing with people where I feel like I need a contract.

9. As a team leader, being the one to fill every silent moment creates an environment which fosters 'dependency'. The group becomes accustomed to the manager calling all the shots, and gradually relinquishes more and more control to him or her. The team becomes less effective, and struggles to function when the manager is not around. --[Embrace Silence](https://tech.forter.com/embrace-silence.html)

10. Delete all standing meetings, every quarter. Jeff Lawson, Founder and CEO of Twilio gave me this awesome advice: Why? (1) Immediately Kills ALL unnecessary standing meetings (2) Makes everyone revisit their calendars and think about their weeks (3) Anything that is important will obviously be added back to the calendar.--[X User](https://twitter.com/jspujji/status/1774449105772650537)
