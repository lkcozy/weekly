1. [Circle of Competence](https://fs.blog/brain-food/august-25-2024/)

The first rule of competition is, you are more likely to win if you play where you have an advantage. Doing so requires a firm understanding of what you know and what you don’t know. Your circle of competence is your personal sphere of expertise, the area where your knowledge and skills are concentrated. It’s the domain where you have a deep understanding, where your judgments are reliable, and your decisions are sound.

The size of your circle isn’t as important as knowing the boundaries. The wise person is the one who knows the limits of their knowledge, who can say with confidence, “This falls within my circle,” or “This is outside my area of expertise.”

Operating within your circle of competence is a recipe for confidence and effectiveness. But venturing outside your circle of competence is a recipe for trouble. You’re like a sailor navigating unfamiliar waters without a map, at the mercy of currents and storms you don’t fully understand. This isn’t to say that you should never venture outside your circle. Learning new things, gaining new skills, and mastering new domains is one of the most beautiful things about life.

Celebrate your expertise, but also acknowledge your limitations.

4. [A guide to refactoring](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/refactor-meaning/)

![](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Approaches.png)

Code rarely starts perfect, so it needs to evolve according to the value it creates for your customers and business.

Refactoring involves improving the quality of the code while preserving its current functionalities.

This creates a more simper, maintainable, and scalable code.

In general, development teams take one of two approaches:

- Build it right from day one. this approach requires a lot of upfront investment and can lead to waste.
- Build to learn, then to scale. prioritize learning over code quality, so you understand whether customers actually want to use your solution. If your product ends up a bust, you can drop it without too much investment. If your product does well, you can refactor and scale.

To help you decide, ask for the following questions:

- How confident are you that customers want the feature?
- What evidence do you have that customers will understand how to use it?
- How do you know the business value you'll collect from it?

The more confident you are, the more you can build from the beginning. Sadly, that’s seldom the case. More often than not, you’ll need to refactor code.

When to refactor

- Frequent problems whenever the code evolves
- Complaints from software engineers about the complexity of the code
- Consistent audience growth

3. [A virtual DOM in 200 lines of JavaScript](https://lazamar.github.io/virtual-dom/)

React, Vue and the Elm language all simplify the creation of interactive web pages by allowing you to describe how you’d like the page to look like, and not worry about adding/removing elements to get there. They do that through a Virtual DOM.

- Virtual DOM is an abstraction to simplify UI modification, allowing users to describe the desired page look without manipulating the real DOM.
- The virtual DOM library involves creating a virtual representation of the DOM, diffing virtual DOM nodes, and applying the diffs to an HTML element.
- Diffing involves comparing old and new nodes to determine modifications like creation, removal, replacement, and property changes.
- Event listeners are efficiently managed using a single listener function and a setListener function to add event listeners to DOM nodes.
- Properties should be set using setAttribute or directly by setting the property in the DOM object based on a predefined list.

4. [One on One Meeting Format Ideas](https://marcgg.com/blog/2021/03/27/one-on-one-format/)

This article discusses a recommended format for one-on-one meetings between managers and their direct reports. The meeting is typically divided into three 10-minute segments:

- Time for the direct report: what do you want to talk about?The employee can discuss anything they want, from project updates to personal matters
- Time for the manager: The manager can ask questions about projects, share information, gather feedback, or engage in casual conversation
- Performance and career discussion: This segment focuses on preventing surprises during annual reviews by discussing performance, coaching, and career path
  - If things are going well they should know it and have a vision of how they can evolve in the company, taking more interesting projects, more responsabilities and, in turn, a better salary.
  - If things are doing poorly, they should be aware that either their pay raise or job is in danger. I should also give them the opportunity to address the issue and improve.

6. [How to be more concise](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-be-concise)

This article on achieving conciseness offers practical insights and strategies for improving communication without sacrificing clarity.

Common Misunderstandings About Conciseness

- Conciseness as a Means to an End: The goal is to be effective, not just short. Use as many words as needed to convey your message clearly.
- Limits of Simplification: Some ideas cannot be simplified beyond a certain point without losing essential meaning. Effective communication requires balancing brevity with completeness.

Strategies for Being More Concise

- Identify Your Main Point: Take time to process information, determine what’s important, and organize your thoughts before speaking or writing.
- Limit to 2-3 Sentences: Aim to express your main idea succinctly, which helps frame the conversation and keeps the audience engaged.
- Avoid Chronological Explanations: Present the main point first to maintain clarity and focus, rather than detailing events in the order they occurred.
- Maintain Situational Awareness: Be aware of your audience's engagement and adjust your delivery accordingly, allowing for pauses and opportunities for interaction.
- Don’t Be Too Concise: Ensure you provide enough context and information to avoid leaving your audience confused or needing to ask basic questions.
- Use a Structure for Written Communication: Implement the "main point above, context below" framework to separate key messages from supporting details.
- Signpost in Verbal Communication: Clearly outline what you will discuss to help guide your audience through your points.
- Proactively Offer Elaboration: Instead of leaving it to your audience to ask questions, suggest specific areas where you can provide more detail.

7. [Wonder why some team members need more guidance than others? It's not about skill.](https://substack.com/@refactoring/note/c-63277431)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1000,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61299526-d53b-4dab-bb16-70e228e36390_800x636.jpeg)

In the book "High Output Management" by Andrew Grove, TRM stands for Task-Relevant Maturity. It is a concept used to determine the most appropriate management style for a subordinate based on their maturity in relation to specific tasks. TRM is not equivalent to general competence or experience; rather, it combines factors such as achievement orientation, readiness to take responsibility, education, training, and experience relevant to a particular task.

TRM is task-specific and is categorized into three levels:

- Low TRM: This requires a structured management approach where the manager provides detailed instructions on what, when, and how tasks should be completed.
- Medium TRM: At this level, management involves more two-way communication, emotional support, and encouragement, focusing more on the individual rather than the task.
- High TRM: Here, minimal managerial involvement is required. The focus is on agreeing on objectives and monitoring progress, allowing the subordinate more autonomy

The concept emphasizes that **management styles should vary according to the TRM of the subordinate**, aiming to enhance their performance and motivation

## Comments

1. The question is not whether we will die, but how we will live

2. There is only one success – to be able to spend your life in your own way.

3. Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world.

4. I’m very pleased to think that there are people with whom I agree on some issues and not others. I don’t want a world in which we all agree. I want a world in which people feel that they have the standing and confidence to feel that they can disagree. I’m interested in why people think as they do.

5. School tests weaknesses. Life rewards strengths. Spending more time on our weakest areas is tempting, but life primarily rewards us for investing in our strengths. Address weaknesses only to the point where they stop holding you back. Then concentrate effort on your strengths.
