Binning is a cartographic technique for visualizing the density of point features by overlaying a grid of uniform shapes onto the dataset and assigning each cell the number of points within it. A graduated color classification is then employed to show visually which cells contain the largest number of points. Different sized shapes can be employed such as rectangles, diamonds, and hexagons.

1. [Dr. Julie Gurner on The difference between discipline and motivation](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/julie-gurner/)

Oftentimes people get the advice that you have to rely on discipline. … one of the things that I find is that discipline requires a lot of push, right? “I’m very disciplined about my workout. I’m really going to push it.”

Motivation is a pull. It is something that is internal that fuels you, that drives you. A number of the people that I tend to work with are very obsessed. You don’t have to push them to go to a meeting.

Great people are obsessed and they’re not slogging through either. They are driven. They are motivated. They are deeply, deeply engaged.

2. [Advice That I Can't Get Out of My Head](https://blog.staysaasy.com/p/advice-that-i-cant-get-out-of-my)

To succeed in high growth environments, it is crucial to learn as quickly as your role is growing in order to prevent burnout, understand SaaS competition dynamics, utilize feelings in decision-making, and invest in strong leadership for teams.

You can get a coach, find mentors, take classes, read, listen to podcasts, or pursue any number of other different ways to learn – the right learning strategy is the one that you’ll actually follow through on.

A good advice should be:

- Actionable: They’ve given me something to emulate or avoid, or helped me to detect signals that might otherwise have blended into the background.
- Insightful: They represent a truth that I probably wouldn’t have reached from my own observation, other than perhaps by dumb luck.
- Trustworthy: I’ve been able to actually see examples of these phenomena in real life.

3. [Setting Clearer Expectations: The Compass vs. Map Method](https://lauratacho.com/blog/setting-clearer-expectations-the-compass-vs-map-method)

The article discusses the importance of setting clear expectations for teams and compares the compass method (providing a general direction) to the map method (providing specific constraints). Knowing what is not enough is a key piece of information for teams to succeed.

We should give our team a map (vs. a compass) to cover the details and constraints to be successful and align our expectations: "I’ve spent hundreds of hours coaching engineering leaders, and even for very senior teams, people often need more direction than we think they do. Specifically, the key piece of information that helps teams succeed is “what’s not enough.” We get this in the map method, by sharing the minimum result, or by sharing an anti-pattern that may cause the team to think they’re doing fine."

4. [High Agency: What Is It, Why It Is Important, and How to Cultivate It](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/high-agency-its-importance-how-cultivate-shreyas-doshi/)

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHzYzJpBl3_kw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1593369565663?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=TioNPaKtO1YhUeYW7DaLUGL4gkdkoR_OTS-_iJY1Xqg)

High Agency is a key attitude for success in life and work, where individuals take control of their circumstances rather than blaming external factors. High Agency individuals take initiative, control what they can, and focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on problems. Cultivating High Agency involves developing traits like an ownership mindset and skills such as creative execution, which can be learned and are rewarding.

"Some Go-Getters become Game-Changers by using their High Agency to get better at their craft and improve their talent. When hiring, I prefer Go-Getters over Frustrated Geniuses. Never compromise on Integrity, not even for Game-Changers." Always start with the language you use (using proactive language), first with yourself and then when talking to others.

5. [Early-Stage Startups: It's All About Depth, Not Breadth](https://twitter.com/jjen_abel/status/1767262042337993172)

It's impossible to know what's working and what's not working unless you're going deep enough. This is why 'horizontal' startups or startups seeking to serve multiple ICP(ideal customer groups)s or use cases are really, really hard and stacking odds against yourself

It's challenging enough to understand one ideal customer group well. Let alone multiple groups who each require a different go-to-market, product feedback, etc.

This is what is referred to as the "bowling pin strategy" coined by Geoffrey Moore. Knock down the first pin and use that momentum to knock down adjacent pins over time.

Jen Abel's advice is also useful for internal products you build. You can try to build something for all of the engineering teams (for example, a new testing platform), or you can focus on a few critical teams and start there. If these teams are important enough internally (perception), use them to build the credibility (social proof) you need to get other teams to adopt it.

6. [When to disagree and commit](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/when-to-disagree-and-commit)

The article discusses the importance of the ability to disagree and commit in decision-making processes, providing questions to consider when determining when to stand your ground and when to concede.

7. [Nine Critical Energy Minerals for Investors](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/nine-critical-energy-minerals-for-investors/)

![](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/VC-Sprott-Minerals-in-Demand-Clean-Energy_20240405.jpg)

Emission-free technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, wind turbines, and nuclear reactors are critical to reducing energy-related emissions and fulfilling net zero goals by 2050.

The nine key clean energy minerals:

- Lithium(EV): An essential component of electrolytes in EV batteries and lithium-based energy storage systems. By 2030, 95% of lithium demand is expected to come from batteries.
- Graphite(EV): The largest component of lithium-ion batteries used for EVs and energy storage.
- Cobalt(EV): Maximizes the stability and longevity of batteries. Cobalt is part of the chemistry of 63% of EV batteries worldwide.
- Copper(Wind&Solar): Essential for conductivity in electrical infrastructure, including wind, solar, and EV charging stations. In general, renewable energy systems can use up to six times more copper than traditional ones.
- Manganese(Wind&Solar): Used as an electrode in many lithium-ion batteries for EVs.
- Silver(Wind&Solar): Essential for conductivity in solar panels and other electrical infrastructure, possessing the highest electrical and thermal conductivity among all metals.
- Rare earths(Wind&Solar): A vital component in the magnets used in wind turbines and EVs.
- Nickel(Wind&Solar,Nuclear): A key element in battery cathodes, offering higher energy density and longer driving ranges for EVs.
- Uranium(Nuclear): The fuel for nuclear power plants that can provide dispatchable and low-carbon power to the electricity grid. Nuclear power ranks as the second-largest contributor to low-carbon electricity production.

## Comments

1. Nobody wants to believe happiness is a choice, because that puts responsibility in their hands. It's the same reason people self-pity: to delay action, to make an outcry to the universe, as though the more they state how bad things are, the more likely it is that someone else will change them. --[Brianna Wiest](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-31-2024/)

2. I once believed, as most od, that if arguments are to be won, the opponent must be pummeled into submission and silenced. You can imagine how that idea played at home. If, in accordance with such a definition, I won an argument, I began to lose the relationship. --[Gerry Spence](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-31-2024/)

3. What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days. Anyone can nourish their most important relationships when life is smooth, but the effort you put in during the rough patches matters more. When you're motivated, eating healthy is easy, but your choices on your toughest days can undo your progress. Keeping your emotions in check is easy when things are going well, but managing your emotions when the world isn't cooperating sets you apart. Push through the grind and maintain the momentum. --[Shane](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-31-2024/)

4. When you know what's coming, prepare. When you don't know what's coming, position. When the future is uncertain, you can position. No one knows what's going to happen with the economy, but you can position yourself against potential loss by spending less than you earn. You don't know what's going to happen to your health, but you can strengthen your position against disease by exercising. You don't know when you might need your friends, but you can be in a good position to ask for their help by being the kind of friend they can count on. Being well-positioned enables anyone to come out ahead no matter what obstacles the unknown may present. --[Shane](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-31-2024/)
