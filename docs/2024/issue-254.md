Map reading is the skill of interpreting geographic information on a map, essential for understanding distance, direction, features, and topography.

Maps offer both relative and absolute location information, with relative locations being in relation to another reference point and absolute locations providing exact positions.

Map legends explain the meaning of symbols and colors used on maps, while map scales indicate the ratio of distance on the map to distance in the real world.

Metadata on maps includes information about cartographers, creation dates, data sources, map projections, and disclaimers.

1. [Thinking of Pivoting Your Strategy? Not So Fast](https://hbr.org/2024/07/is-it-time-to-pivot-your-strategy)

As a manager, keeping your team agile and adaptable is essential. But it can be hard to know whether pivoting strategies is the right move or a big misstep. Here are some key questions to ask before making a big change to your team's strategy.

**Is poor execution the real issue?** Assess your assumptions and performance. A great plan can fail without proper implementation, so ensure your team has the right skills and commitment. Sometimes, improving execution of the strategy you already have can eliminate the need for a pivot.

**Are you reacting to the outside pressures?** Stakeholders can be patient, and their anxiety can prompt unnecessary and counterproductive changes. Critically evaluate their concerns by asking: Are the issues they raise valid or misguided? Resist making changes to appease stakeholders if your strategy is well-founded and progressing well. And formulate a persuasive argument to help them understand why their trepidation is premature.

**Is a new opportunity distracting you?** New ideas and technologies are always arising, and they can be tempting to pursue. But when a compelling opportunity presents itself, carefully consider whether it's actually help you reach your goal more efficiently. It may not be worth the risk of diverting focus and resources just yet.

2. [Too detailed in the wrong ways, not detailed enough in the right ways](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/too-detailed-in-the-wrong-ways)

Details aren’t the problem. The problem is too many of the wrong details.

- Being too detailed in the wrong ways can lead to information overload and confusion.
- It is essential to decide and include the right details based on the audience, situation, and goals. Make sure you understand the assignment before you dive into it.
- Sharing unnecessary technical information, failing to provide context, and misreading the task can hinder effective communication. It’s more valuable to share notes AND your takeaways, analysis, and insights.

How to decide what details to include

- What is your main point and why is this important?
- What is your goal in sharing this information?
- What action do you want your recipient to take?
- Are you really answering the question they’re asking?
- How much does your audience already know?

A few other thoughts to keep in mind:

- If you think your audience might think you’re being too detailed, mention why those details are important to include.
  - “I’m sharing this because…” or “These details matter because…”
- Consider what the person needs to know vs what’s secondary.
- You're not always going to get it right.
- When you catch yourself sharing too many details as you’re speaking in real-time, gracefully finish your sentence and bring it back to your main point.

3. [The OARB framework: Why you should appeal to self-interest when giving feedback](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/oarb-framework-appeal-to-self-interest)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed96b885-2808-4597-9e70-cea1285c28a9_2542x1026.png)

Utilize the OARB framework (Observation, Assertion, Repercussion, Benefit) to structure your feedback effectively by outlining specific behavior, its negative impact, and potential benefits to the recipient.

Appeal to self-interest when giving feedback, as people are wired to care about how they look, want their fair share, and see the world through a self-centric lens.

Avoid making claims about someone's character or personality when giving feedback, and instead focus on discussing specific behavior to prevent pushback and increase receptiveness to your feedback.

- Observation: “When you say/do X….”: Describe their specific behavior or words
- Assertion: “It makes you look/seem [bad thing]...”: Describe how they’re coming across negatively
- Repercussion: “Which isn’t great because [impact on you]...”: Describe how they’re making life harder for themselves
- Benefit: “If you do [suggested action], these good things might happen.”: Appeal to how they can make life easier for themselves or get more of what they want

## Example 1: A VP giving feedback to their director-level report

Observation: “When you don’t manage up or share what your team is working on…

Assertion: …senior leadership has no idea what you’re doing. I’m sharing this because I want to make sure operators who are doing great work actually get elevated and promoted within Acme.

Repercussion: If senior management doesn’t know what you and your team are contributing, then less hard-working people and less talented people are going to get promoted over you, which isn’t good for you or the company.

Benefit: If you take 10% of your efforts toward managing expectations and socializing ideas, you’ll be seen more as a leader, get more support, and face less skepticism. You mentioned wanting to get promoted, and at the VP level, you will have to do even more managing up. Now is a great time to practice being less in the weeds while the stakes are a bit lower.”

Why this works:

- Share logic the person would agree with: Most operators would agree that folks who do good work should get promoted.
- Appeal to their sense of fairness: They probably don’t want less talented people who are good talkers to get promoted over them.
- Quote the person back to themselves: They said they want to get promoted, so I’m framing this feedback through the lens of what they’d told me they wanted.
- Appeal to logic again: The reason to start practicing managing up now is because you’ll only have to do more of it later.

## Example 2: An executive sharing feedback with a peer

Observation: “When you say ‘yeah sure’ to things you obviously disagree with, then proceed to do the opposite,

Assertion: …it makes you seem shady. People can’t trust what you say, because when you say ‘yeah sure’ it might mean ‘yes I agree’ or ‘no I disagree and don’t plan on actually doing this once I get back to my desk.’

Repercussion: This isn’t great because people will begin to doubt everything you say, and might question you more. You'll waste more time answering questions and convincing people, instead of focusing on the work.

Benefit: I understand that at the moment, you might feel weird disagreeing, so having a go-to phrase might help. For example, saying “Hmm let me think about that because I’m not sure I agree and I want to come back to this when I can explain my logic better.” That way, you’re not agreeing, and you’re taking accountability by trying to convince them of your POV. This might make your life easier.”

Why this works:

- Lay the foundation with an objective assertion: I assert that if “yes” could mean “yes” or “no,” this is rightfully confusing. I call this out clearly, respectfully, and directly. If they want to debate on why that’s not confusing, we can discuss it.
- Talk about the downsides: No one wants to spend time wasting time answering needless questions and making their own life harder.
- Anticipate the roadblock: Even if the person is convinced, they might not know how to disagree productively. (If they were skilled at dealing with conflict, we wouldn’t be in this situation.) So I proactively share a simple script they can use, which should persuade them it’s easier to change than they think.

4. [A Cheat Sheet for Designing Fault-Tolerant Systems](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/147766522/a-cheat-sheet-for-designing-fault-tolerant-systems)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1568f10-1350-4435-a06f-60d31d4ccbbf_1280x1657.gif)

Designing fault-tolerant systems is crucial for ensuring high availability and reliability in various applications. Here are six top principles of designing fault-tolerant systems:

- Replication: involves creating multiple copies of data or services across different nodes or locations.
- Redundancy: refers to having additional components or systems that can take over in case of a failure.
- Load Balancing: distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a point of failure.
- Failover Mechanisms: automatically switch to a standby system or component when the primary one fails.
- Graceful Degradation: ensures that a system continues to operate at reduced functionality rather than completely failing when some components fail.
- Monitoring and Alerting: Continuously monitor the system's health and performance, and set up alerts for any anomalies or failures.

5. [10 System Design Tradeoffs You Cannot Ignore](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/147766522/system-design-tradeoffs-you-cannot-ignore)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c3e3af8-5a12-4036-8a93-ef17c5461d8b_800x998.gif)

Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

- Vertical scaling is adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to an existing server.
- Horizontal scaling means adding more servers to the pool.

SQL vs NoSQL

- SQL databases organize data into tables of rows and columns.
- NoSQL is ideal for applications that need a flexible schema.

Batch vs Stream Processing

- Batch processing involves collecting data and processing it all at once. For example, daily billing processes.
- Stream processing processes data in real time. For example, fraud detection processes.

Normalization vs Denormalization

- Normalization splits data into related tables to ensure that each piece of information is stored only once.
- Denormalization combines data into fewer tables for better query performance.

Consistency vs Availability

- Consistency is the assurance of getting the most recent data every single time.
- Availability is about ensuring that the system is always up and running, even if some parts are having problems.

Strong vs Eventual Consistency

- Strong consistency is when data updates are immediately reflected.
- Eventual consistency is when data updates are delayed before being available across nodes.

REST vs GraphQL

- With REST endpoints, you gather data by accessing multiple endpoints.
- With GraphQL, you get more efficient data fetching with specific queries but the design cost is higher.

Stateful vs Stateless

- A stateful system remembers past interactions.
- A stateless system does not keep track of past interactions.

Read-Through vs Write-Through Cache

- A read-through cache loads data from the database in case of a cache miss.
- A write-through cache simultaneously writes data updates to the cache and storage.

Sync vs Async Processing

- In synchronous processing, tasks are performed one after another.
- In asynchronous processing, tasks can run in the background. New tasks can be started without waiting for a new task.

## Comments

1. No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story. --[Daniel Kahneman](https://fs.blog/brain-food/august-18-2024/)

2. The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come. --[Steve Jobs](https://fs.blog/brain-food/august-18-2024/)

3. So many advantages come from being willing to look like an idiot in the short term. You stay silent in an important meeting, afraid to voice critical thoughts and watch the project fail. You don’t write the novel because you’re afraid people might not read it. You don’t admit you were wrong and repeatedly make the same mistake. You don’t ask the person out because you’re scared of rejection. You don’t start the business because you might fail. You don’t say sorry because you’re waiting for the other person to go first A few seconds of discomfort changes everything.

4. I have never regretted shipping something too fast. Ever. Meanwhile, I have often regretted waiting and shipping slower.

5. It’s amazing how much easier things gets once you just start.
