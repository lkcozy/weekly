Google is planning to use satellite data, AI technology, and computing power to map methane emissions. MethaneSAT will provide near real-time data to poinpoint sources of methane worldwide.

Yellow dots mark the source, while purple, orange, and yellow shading shows how the emissions diffused over a wider area.

> Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that's responsible for nearly a third of global warming. Nearly 40% of manmade methane comes from oil, gas, and coal operations.

AI Image to Music Generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to convert images into music.

The principle behind it should be to use image captions to understand images first, then generate music related prompts, and finally generate music clips.

1. [Polling vs Webhooks](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/141963246/polling-vs-webhooks)

- Polling involves repeatedly checking the external service or endpoint at fixed intervals to retrieve updated information.
  - data flow: data fetching happens on demand
  - resource utilization: higher resource consumption
  - developer control: greater control on when to fetch data
  - risks: struggles in high throughput situation
- Webhook are like having a built-in notification system
  - data flow: data is pushed to the application
  - resource utilization: efficient use of resources
  - developer control: real-time updates
  - risks: chances of missing notifications
  - there is a risk of missed notifications due to network issues, hence proper retry mechanisms are needed

2. [The Great Mental Models Summary](https://fourminutebooks.com/the-great-mental-models-summary/)

The Great Mental Models will improve your decision-making process by sharing some unique but well-documented thinking models you can use to interact more efficiently with world and other people.

> You can't improve if you don't know what you're doing wrong.

Your mental models are your best, or worst, toolkit you have on your hand when making decisions. These are the multitude of your thinking traits, the recollection of your past decisions and their outcomes, life lessons, and all the other circumstances that shaped the way you think today.

Here are three favorite lessons from the book:

- Know what you're good at and seek help when you encounter an area of weakness for you.
- Solve a problem by looking at its underlying cause and by practicing inversion.
- Play scenarios in your head before you try them in the real world and assess the long-term effects of your decisions.

## Comments

1. Amateurs have a goal. Professionals have a system. --[Going Pro](https://fs.blog/amateurs-professionals/)

2. Luck is the intersection of preparation and opportunity. Opportunities parade past all of us all the time. The key is that you must be paying attention to see them, you must be willing to take risks, you must expose yourself to the possibility of massive failure and you must believe in what you are doing so much that you do it anyway.

3. Many of life’s failures are people who didn’t realize how close they were to success when they gave up.

4. So much advantage in life comes from being willing to look like a failure in the short term.

5. Consistent progress compounds.Inconsistent progress is a lie.Make a little progress today on your most important objective. Repeat tomorrow.
