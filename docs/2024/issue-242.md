## Comments

1. You don’t want fame, you want respect. Respect comes from living up to their standards. You don’t want respect, you want self-respect. Self-respect comes from living up to your own standards. The same standards that you apply to other people. --[Naval](https://x.com/naval/status/1788915647348707744)
