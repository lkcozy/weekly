Chinese companies are expected to account for nearly 70% of global battery capacity by 2030, delivering over 6,200 gigawatt-hours. Chinese giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) alone is forecasted to produce more than the combined output from Canada, France, Hungary, Germany, and the UK.

2. [Space-to-tree: Architectural framework for real-time monitoring of pines in natural and historical park](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/itl2.574)

The "Space-to-tree" project was an initiative by the European Space Agency aimed at developing an alert system for real-time monitoring of tree stability.

The project focused on creating an architectural framework for monitoring pine trees in natural and historical park settings.

- Multisensor Approach: The project utilized a multisensor and multiscale remote sensing-based approach for monitoring monumental trees.
- Real-time Monitoring: The system was designed to provide real-time alerts about tree stability, allowing for proactive management of tree health and safety.
- OGC SensorThings API: The framework centered around the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API, which likely facilitated standardized data exchange and interoperability between various sensors and systems.

1. [Reciprocity](https://fs.blog/brain-food/september-1-2024/)

Reciprocity underlies everything from basic human kindness to the most complex trade systems. At its core, reciprocity is the simple idea of treating others as they treat us—giving what we get.

From this simple principle grows a vast web of social interactions and expectations that shapes nearly every aspect of our lives.

Many people seem to expect the world to hand them things without effort. This is a poor strategy because it doesn’t align with the human behavior you can observe around you every day.

Reciprocation teaches us that if you give people cynicism and curtness or nothing at all, you are likely to receive the same. But if you give people an opportunity and the benefit of the doubt, you will often be on the receiving end of the same behavior.

Become what you want to see in the world, and the world will return it to you. If you want an amazing relationship with your partner, be an amazing partner. If you want people to be thoughtful and kind to you, be thoughtful and kind to them.

If you want people to listen to you, listen to them. The best way to achieve success is to deserve success. Small changes in your actions change your entire world.

One of the biggest misperceptions about reciprocity is that people should sit around waiting for others to go first rather than unlocking the power of reciprocity in their favor by going positive and going first without expectation.

Reciprocity reminds us that our actions tend to come back on us. It’s a reminder that we are part of the world, and thus our actions do not happen in isolation but are instead part of an interconnected web of effects.

2. [A Cheatsheet for UML Class Diagrams](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/147924677/a-cheatsheet-for-uml-class-diagrams)

UML is a standard way to visualize the design of your system and class diagrams are used across the industry.

They consist of:

- Class: Acts as the blueprint that defines the properties and behavior of an object.
- Attributes: Attributes in a UML class diagram represent the data fields of the class.
- Methods:Methods in a UML class diagram represent the behavior that a class can perform.
- Interfaces: Defines a contract for classes that implement it. Includes a set of methods that the implementing classes must provide.
- Enumeration: A special data type that defines a set of named values such as product category or months in a year.
- Relationships: Determines how one class is related to another. Some common relationships are as follows:
  - Association
  - Aggregation
  - Composition
  - Inheritance
  - Implementation

## Comments

1. Most geniuses-especially those who lead others-prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities.

2. People are always looking for happiness at some future time and in some new thing, or some new set of circumstances, in possession of which they some day expect to find themselves. But the fact is, if happiness is not found now, where we are, and as we are, there is little chance of it ever being found. There is a great deal more happiness around us day by day than we have the sense or the power to seek and find. --[Essays on Life](https://amzn.to/3ASNoWN)

3. There are two times to admit mistakes: early and late. Early admissions solve problems. Late admissions create them. A person who proactively tells another they made a mistake gains trust and respect for their honesty. In contrast, one who tries to hide mistakes quickly loses trust.

4. Burnout happens when there is no progress. Burnout also happens when you have no visibility into how dots will connect in the future. Burnout is about not being able to close the loop after putting a ton of effort and not seeing enough results.

5. The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation." (1) You create a habit to automate the process. (2) If you perform a habit enough times then you don’t have to decide. (3) Deciding causes decision fatigue which sucks away your precious daily energy.
