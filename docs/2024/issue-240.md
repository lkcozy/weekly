GIS data refers to information that is explicitly linked to locations on the Earth’s surface, with attribute data enhancing spatial information by connecting specific characteristics to geographic coordinates.

- GIS data can be spatially referenced (vector and raster forms) or in attribute tables (tabular format).
- Vector data is the most common type of GIS data, representing geographic data as points, lines, or polygons.
- Raster data represents data as a matrix of cells with attribute values, commonly found in remotely sensed data and imagery.
- Raster data can be continuous or discrete, with floating point values allowing for high precision but requiring more storage and processing power.
- Different sources of GIS data include government agencies, commercial providers, remote sensing, and open-source platforms.

1. [When to disagree and commit](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/when-to-disagree-and-commit)

The article discusses the importance of being able to disagree and commit in decision-making processes, providing insights on when to stand your ground and when to go along with another idea.

- Disagreeing and committing is crucial in situations where there is no clear answer on what to do.
- The ability to build conviction through debate is essential before making a decision.
- Have I made as strong of a business case as I could make? Sharing one's rationale and making a strong business case is important before disagreeing and committing.
- Do I believe the other party understands my points? Understanding that people can comprehend your perspective but still disagree is key.
- Have I addressed counterpoints? Blind persistence without addressing counterpoints is not effective.
- How high are the stakes? Removing ego from the debate allows for a more nuanced conversation and better decision-making.
- How good are the alternatives? Recognizing when someone else's idea is better and committing fully is a sign of leadership maturity.

David Perell provides 18 frameworks you can explore further.

- Location, vocation, relation: Where you live, what you do, who you're dating or married to. Try not to change more than one at a time.
- Do something fast, do it for cheap, do it at a high quality. Pick two.
- Head, heart, wallet: Three questions to ask yourself if you don't know what to write about — what does your head want you to write about? what does your heart want you to write about? what does your wallet want you to write about?
- Frank Slootman's mantra for running companies: increase the tempo, raise the standards, narrow the focus.
- High/Low self-monitors: High self-monitors adjust to the people around them. They're highly flexible and good at getting along with people, but they can be social chameleons. Low self-monitors don't adjust to their audience or change their behavior based on the situation.
- Voice, exit, and loyalty: If you're frustrated with a situation, there are three ways to respond: (1) voice means making a complaint or offering a suggestion, (2) exit means to leave the situation, and (3) loyalty means to put your head down and stay.
- The shape of stories: A character who wants something encounters a problem before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a guide steps into their lives, gives them a plan, and calls them to action. That action helps them avoid failure and ends in a success. (Source: Donald Miller)
- At any point in a movie, you should be able to pause and ask: (1) what does the hero want? (2) who or what is stopping the hero from getting what they want? (3) What will the hero's life look like if they get what they want?
- Focus on the 5-second moment of change to tell better stories: Every story revolves around a single, transformative moment In that moment. The clearer and more dramatic the flip or realization, the better the story.
- One-way door vs. Two-way door decisions: One-way door decisions like selling your company or quitting your job are almost impossible to reverse, and you should make them slowly. Two-way door decisions like starting a hobby or changing your prices are easy to reverse, and you should make them faster. Most decisions are two-way doors.
- The four types of work tasks: (1) need to do, love to do, (2) need to do, but don't love to do, (3) don't need to do, love to do, and (4) don't need to do, don't love to do.
- The Eisenhower Matrix says there are four kinds of tasks: (1) Urgent and important, (2) urgent and not important, (3) not urgent and not important, and (4) important but not urgent.
- General and Specific: If you’re stuck on something general, zoom into the specifics. If you’re stuck on something specific, zoom out to the general.
- Three rules for copywriting: Write things that are concrete, visual, and falsifiable.
- Fast-twitch and slow-twitch thinkers: People exist on a spectrum. Fast-twitch people speak fast, work fast, and crave novelty. Throw a problem their way and they'll come up with 3–5 solutions in a matter of minutes. They're the people you want in the room when you're brainstorming an idea. Slow-twitch people are much more deliberate. Throw a problem at them and they'll ask for time to think about it, only to come back with something deeper, more polished, and more organized than a fast-twitch person could ever generate. You need both kinds of people for a group to be successful.
- The TOP framework for finding what somebody should work on: Talent, organization, and passion. What are you talented at? What serves the organization? What are you passionate about? The perfect gig has all three.
- The Keith Rabois formula for billion-dollar startups: "Find large highly fragmented industry w/ low NPS; vertically integrate a solution to simplify the value of the product."
- The Sexy-Boring Matrix: When investing, look for companies in the unsexy + boring categories. Why? Because everything in the universe is a supply & demand curve. People want to work on things that are sexy and simple. Doing the opposite tends to lead to less competition, and therefore, higher returns. Without complexity, it's hard to be differentiated. And the sexy and complex categories attracts brilliant entrepreneurs who are hard to compete with

3. [How to share your point of view (even if you’re afraid of being wrong)](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/high-performers-share-their-point-of-view)

High performers often struggle with sharing their point of view due to fear of being wrong, but it is crucial to speak up confidently, and this article provides tips on how to do that effectively.

- The more controversial the idea, the higher the burden of proof, and it is important to vet your own thinking rigorously before sharing.
  - Why might what you’re saying be true?
  - Where might it not be true?
  - What are the most obvious counterpoints?
- As a high performer, updating your assumptions about how you add value and developing a distinct point of view is essential for growth.
- When sharing a hunch, it is crucial to explain where it comes from, provide evidence, describe why the problem matters.
  - what patterns you’re noticing
  - what you’re observing on the ground floor
  - what risks/opportunities you see
  - what you recommend as a next step
- It is important to avoid relying solely on credentials or your title and to use language that accurately reflects your level of certainty, be rooted in logic, and make sense.
  - ✅ Here’s my idea. My POV is we should do X because I've noticed Y and Z has been happening. I believe this matters because **_ and my takeaway is we should do _**.
  - 🚫 Here’s my idea. I’m VP of Growth, so my growth strategies speak for themselves.
- Use language that accurately reflects your level of certainty.
  - ✅ My initial hunch is leaning toward X because I’ve been noticing Y and Z. I can see this meaning a couple different things. I don't have high conviction yet and would like to discuss.
  - 🚫 This is how it is.

## Comments

1. I believe instinct is millions of subconscious data points accrued over time, reps, and lived experience. Especially when you’re building something new, there’s often not enough data to “prove” that you should do x or y. It could go either way, and you can’t or won’t know until 3-6 months later if you were right. --[How to share your point of view (even if you’re afraid of being wrong)](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/high-performers-share-their-point-of-view)
