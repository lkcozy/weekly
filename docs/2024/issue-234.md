A new versatile time series model called UniTS (Unified Time Series model), it was developed as a versatile tool that can handle a wide range of time series tasks without the need for time-consuming and individualized adjustments. The goal of UniTS is be accepted as a tool to simplify the the modeling process for time series analysis that is dependent on disparate data sets.

The authors of the model hope that UniTS will enhance researchers’ capacity to streamline the analysis of temporal patterns from a collection of datasets, whether it’s for financial forecasting, healthcare diagnostics, or environmental conservation.

1. [11 ways to get better feedback from your manager](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/get-better-feedback)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fda8c74-9a13-4491-b3fe-3341f9d511af_1514x1204.png)

### Make it insanely easy for your manager to give your feedback

Ask more specific prompts rather than only say "I'd love to get your feedback", it gives your manager more to react to. Make it easy for people to give you what you want. Every bit of friction prolongs the time you'll have to wait for your manager to reply.

### Feedback might feel loaded

Ask what to do differently and what worked well. You can ask for thoughts, input, initial reaction etc. The goal is to get insight on how to improve your work.

- What would you do differently? What’s missing?
- What would you do if you were in this situation?
- Do you see any risks or logical gaps that I missed?
- Could you mark which parts of this memo are confusing?
- What is the most interesting 20% of this? Most boring 20%?

### Give them permission to rip your work apart

Encourage your manager to be extremely direct with you. If you’re a direct report, you do not want your manager to feel the need to “translate” too much because it reduces the chances they’ll give you feedback at all. You benefit when your manager can speak freely with you. You can say, “**Feel free to be super direct. If this sucks, tell me and share why/how I can improve because I want to learn. Feel free to rip it apart.**”

### Don’t romanticize feedback. You might already be getting it—you just wish it looked different

One day, I realized, my manager taking the time to rip my work into shreds and **explaining their thought process with actionable edits**… This WAS coaching me. This WAS mentoring me.

Don’t romanticize feedback. Coaching, mentoring, feedback, etc doesn’t only show up in the form of career conversations. **If your manager is letting you know what you could do better, that’s feedback**.

### Give your manager something concrete to react to

It's easier for folks to give you feedback on a piece of work product you can both see in front of you. This serves as a jumping-off point for further discussion. It's easier for people to recognize something on a list than to recall from scratch.

- ✅ I drafted a strategy doc. What about this resonates? What are you skeptical about?
- ❌ Can you teach me about strategy?

### Don’t expect your manager to create a structured lesson plan for you

It’s not your manager’s responsibility to teach you. It’s their responsibility to create the circumstances for you to learn. There’s a difference.

Sometimes this involves sitting down and teaching you, but 95% of the time it involves you taking the lead, learning on your own, and keeping your manager informed on what you need (budget, reimbursement for a course, access to resources).

In an ideal world, formal learning would happen during work hours.

But in my experience, when I’m getting up to speed on a new channel, technology, or skill, I almost always learn after work or on weekends. There was simply too much happening during normal business hours.

Whether you want to invest time after hours to learn is up to you. I’m sharing so you don’t beat yourself up for never seeming to have time to learn during work hours, and so you can set realistic expectations for yourself.

### React positively when you get feedback

When you react negatively, your manager is disincentivized from engaging. They might say they "don't have time" but that's only partially true.

- Share why the feedback was helpful or insightful
- Explicitly say that you appreciate their feedback

### Frame why giving you feedback is ROI positive. It’s not always obvious or true

Giving feedback isn't a single step, including:

- understand the situation and context
- analyze, diagnose, and consider implications
- figure out how to explain your thinking so it feels simple and persuasive

If your manager isn't quick to give you feedback, it might be because they don't see the upside to doing all this. They would rather spend their time on other highly-leveraged tasks.

To increase your chance of getting them to engage with you, you may want to sell them on the upside:

- If you have this answer, how will it save money or make money for the company?
- How will it empower you to add more value?
- How will feedback now improve everything that comes after?

If your response is “getting an answer to my question doesn’t really impact my ability to add value to the business,” your question might not be worth the time to discuss.

If addressing your question doesn't contribute to that, it makes sense why senior leaders would deprioritize it.

### Specify what part you need help with

Don’t forward a 17-email deep thread and say, “Thoughts?”. Assume your manager doesn’t have context. If you want them to help you, drop them 2 inches in front of the problem and say which part you need help with. Ask yourself:

- What are my assertions about what to do?
- What specifically am I unsure about?
- What options am I debating between?
- What decision am I trying to make?

### Be explicit about the type of feedback you’re looking for

There are many ways your manager can support you. When you share what you need directly and respectfully, you’re more likely to get it. Don’t make your manager guess.

Before: Hey, can you take a look?

After:

- Hey, can you take a look? I’m looking for high-level directional feedback. No need for line edits yet.
- I’d love to get super specific feedback. These particular sections are a bit confusing.
- I have updates on X. Let’s discuss by tomorrow EOD because Y.
- I’m frustrated by X. I would love to vent a bit and get it out of my system.
- The kind of feedback that would be most helpful is XYZ.

### Be the kind of operator managers want to invest in

At the end of the day, managers invest in people they believe are worth investing in. It’s a bit circular and common sense, but it’s worth saying because there are a few implications.

Generally, you want to behave like someone who learns quickly, is going places, and is a strong performer. You want to act like an owner and do what’s best for the business. When you have a history of good judgment and continuous improvement, this makes your manager want to give you more feedback.

2. [12-Factor App](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/143063872/have-you-heard-of-the-factor-app)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcba22e09-a291-4efc-9014-106e49f17d28_1280x1664.gif)

- Codebase: Have one place to keep all your code, and manage it using version control like Git.
- Dependencies: List all the things your app needs to work properly, and make sure they're easy to install.
- Config: Keep important settings like database credentials separate from your code, so you can change them without rewriting code.
- Backing Services: Use other services (like databases or payment processors) as separate components that your app connects to.
- Build, Release, Run: Make a clear distinction between preparing your app, releasing it, and running it in production.
- Processes: Design your app so that each part doesn't rely on a specific computer or memory. It's like making LEGO blocks that fit together.
- Port Binding: Let your app be accessible through a network port, and make sure it doesn't store critical information on a single computer.
- Concurrency: Make your app able to handle more work by adding more copies of the same thing, like hiring more workers for a busy restaurant.
- Disposability: Your app should start quickly and shut down gracefully, like turning off a light switch instead of yanking out the power cord.
- Dev/Prod Parity: Ensure that what you use for developing your app is very similar to what you use in production, to avoid surprises.
- Logs: Keep a record of what happens in your app so you can understand and fix issues, like a diary for your software.
- Admin Processes: Run special tasks separately from your app, like doing maintenance work in a workshop instead of on the factory floor.

## Comments

1. While we naturally understand that writing is a good way to share ideas with others, we under-appreciate just how much good writing helps us think about an idea to ourselves. Writing is not only a means of communication, it enables us to practice reasoning.--[How to Think Better](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/)

2. You can't achieve greatness by doing what everyone else is doing. If your choices resemble those of your friends, you'll get the same results they get.

3. The biggest decision you make daily is what to focus on.

4. Common causes of bad decisions:

- Not asking, "and then what?"
- Blindness to large trends (blind spots)
- Assumption based on small sample sizes
- Conforming to expectations/authority/group
- Wanting the world to work the way we want rather than the way it does

5. The single most powerful thing you can do in a relationship, whether it's personal or professional, is to give someone 100% of your attention. --[Brad Jacobs](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/brad-jacobs/)

6. Managers should consider how they deliver feedback AND direct reports should toughen up about hearing feedback. Both parties should do their part. --[Wes Gao](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/get-better-feedback)
