China launched 18 satellites for the system in 2018 alone. As of the end of June, there were 35 BeiDou satellites in operation, compared with 31 for GPS. The EU, meanwhile, has 22 positioning satellites and Russia 24. Japan operates four, which are limited to regional use, while India has six. Chinese satellites were observed more frequently than GPS satellites in 130 of 195 countries(most of them are along the One Belt and One Road).

Many organizations often collect a large amount of time-series data as part of their operations. By collecting data in this way, they are able to conduct real-time and even predictive analysis to better inform current and future decision making. However, it can be particularly challenging when it comes to benchmarking the performance of various database technologies before running them in production scenarios.

Timescale introduced the Time Series Benchmark Suite (TSBS) as a tool for comparing and evaluating databases for time-series workloads. The primary goal of TSBS is help take the guesswork out of benchmarking by simplifying the experience of generating time-series datasets, and comparing insert & query performance on a host of database technologies.

# Tool

1. [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb)

![](https://assets.iobeam.com/images/docs/illustration-hierarchy.svg)

TimescaleDB is an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable for time-series data. It is packaged as a PostgreSQL extension, which provided automatic partitioning across time and space (partitioning key), as well as full SQL support.

2. [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/)

![](https://www.influxdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2.0-Capture.gif)

InfluxDB is a high-performance data store explicitly implemented for time series data. It allows for high throughput ingest, compression and real-time querying. It's written entirely in GO and provides expressive SQL-like query language.
