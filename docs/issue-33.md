# GISer's Weekly Issue 33

## GeoSpatial

1. [COTA Tracking](https://blog.mapbox.com/national-security-and-defense-council-of-ukraine-covid-19-common-operating-application-e7da20513a4f)
   ![COTA](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*wZLo2UR4oIKR9-G3)
   The map provides daily updated COVID-19 statistics on laboratory-confirmed cases, suspected infections, and the number of patients, including those who have recovered and those who have died.

2. [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/)
   ![OpenNameSearch](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/cfbd4cac8ea603eeaa2f002c8c4fe092f5c7cc96/687474703a2f2f6f70656e6e616d657365617263682e6f72672f6173736574732f696d672f4e6f6d696e6174696d2d57656c636f6d652e6a7067)
   Nominatim is a search engine for OpenStreetMap data. It supports both forward search(search for a name or address) and reverse search(look up data by its geographic coordinates). Each result comes with a link to a detail page where you can inspect what data about the object is saved in the database and investigate how the address of the object has been computed.

3. [World Central Kitchenâ€™s Chefs for America map](https://blog.mapbox.com/world-central-kitchens-map-to-feed-america-9c48dfa003df)
   ![World Central Kitchen]https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*2lFYwMqXxxgjOQlv
   It's built from crowd-sourced data displaying available meals at three types of locations: School districts, restaurants, and World Central Kitchen community kitchens and meal distribution points. The goal of this project is to safely distribute healthy, fresh meals across the country to those in need due to the COVIDD-19 epidemic.

4. [eXXpedition tracking map](https://exxpedition.com/news/track-the-boat/)
   ![eXXpedition tracking map](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*KmyV7syh0p0BZPZx9-Airw.png)
   An interactive map to monitor all-female research expeditions to investigate the causes of and solutions to ocean plastic pollution. The map is designed to connect eXXpedition with everyone watching from shore, and to help people explorer the deeper stories and science behind the ocean circulation and plastic pollution.

   Ship location coordinates are sent by the on-board YB Tracker every six hours via a satellite connection. To add context to the ocean voyage, the map also includes data layers for bathymetry(ocean depth), currents, wind, and models of ocean plastic gyres

## AI

1. [Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark](https://github.com/cchen156/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark)
   ![Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark](https://github.com/cchen156/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark/raw/master/images/fig1.png)
   This is a Tensorflow implementation of Learning to See in the Dark. Authors developed a pipeline for processing low-light images, based on end-to-end training of a fully-convolutional network. The network operates directly on raw sensor data and replaces much of the traditional image processing pipeline, which tends to perform poorly on such data.

## Tool

1. [a-Shell](https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/)
   ![a-Shell](https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/assets/screenshot/nslookup.png)
   A Terminal in your pocket or on your desk to allow you to program on your iPad or iPhone.

2. [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop)
   ![tabletop.js](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vdYratZj9Hw/We_XS-025HI/AAAAAAAAG08/FhoOlea87OkeBV8IiRKbpgRskAZxaw2qQCLcBGAs/s1600/spreadsheettodata.png)
   Tabletop.js takes a Google Spreadsheets and makes it easily accessible through JavaScript.

## Comments

1. Heisenbug is a type of computer bug that disappears or changes behaviour when an attempt to debug is made. This is a pun on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which can be loosely understood as the tradeoff between the physical measurements of a particle. As you try to precisely measure the location of a particle, its momentum becomes more uncertain, and vice versa. Similarly, as attempts are made to precisely probe the Heisenbug, the problem disappears.
