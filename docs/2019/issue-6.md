1. [On the extinction of species](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/09/20/a-million-species-of-plant-and-animal-are-at-risk-of-extinction)

![Hotspots of human impact on threatened terrestrial vertebrates](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/2019/09/articles/main/20190914_wom993.png)

Recent research reveals hotspots where the highest number of land animals are threatened by human activities such as agriculture, urbanization and transport. Some of the worst affected countries are in South-East Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand. Many species are also in danger in southern Brazil and north-east India.

According to a UN report published in May, nature is being destroyed at a rate “unprecedented in human history.” A million species of animals and plants are at risk of extinction, equivalent to more than a tenth of the number of species on earth.

2. [Power Chart of Chinese Provinces](http://www.xiaoji-chen.com/2011/china-power-chart)

![Population Power Chart of Chinese Provinces](http://www.xiaoji-chen.com/images/china/power-population.png)

The author created density-equalizing maps to visualize how actually important the Chinese provinces. The above picture shows the population power chart of Chinese provinces. The areas are proportional to population. The colour indicates the percentage of residents who live there at least six months per year but from other provinces. You can recognize in this map how unbalanced China is. The west is barely occupied due to the challenging environment, and the population keeps flowing from the middle towards the economic centers (Beijing and the southeast coast). They become both productivity and pressure for big cities.

The following map shows how often every two provinces appear in the same media coverage. The area of the circle shows mentions in the news. The width of the connection shows mentions of the pair in coverage.
![Social Power Chart of Chinese Provinces](http://www.xiaoji-chen.com/images/china/power-social.jpg)
It is clear that Beijing is the absolute, mono-center of all China. Social power is not proportional to a province's population. The south and the east coast get far more attention than inland provinces, which is a sad fact.

3. [Trase.earth](https://trase.earth/flows)

Trase.earth provides an open-access information platform for tracing the international flow of agricultural commodities. At the heart of Trase is a beautiful, interactive Sankey diagram that visualizes the journey, soy and beef takes before arriving on your plate. Trase.earth makes it possible to follow how sourcing patterns and trade flows have evolved over a period. It can help us to explore what factors might be driving those changes and identify new opportunities to improve sustainability.

These data are now available on the Trase data portal free of charge, so researchers and analysts can use for their work.

4. [deckgl-point-animation](https://peterbeshai.com/blog/2019-08-10-deckgl-point-animation/)

![](../images/issue-6-1.gif)

The author shows how to animate 17,000+ public libraries in the US on maps with deck.gl.

5. [USA 224](https://www.universetoday.com/143298/thanks-to-trump-weve-got-a-better-idea-of-the-capabilities-of-us-surveillance-satellites/)

Thanks to Trump, we’ve got a better idea of the capabilities of US Surveillance satellites. Trump's tweet unwittingly revealed some of the capabilities of a top-secret satellite called USA 224, an optical reconnaissance satellite.

## AI/ML

1. [AI Farmbots Want Jobs Americans Don't](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/business/robot-farmers/index.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=77004961&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8d2U4S4iDBzB0IS5LFTVCl6Ip3Ybv7ct1TEh-pTLn5sPUgwEZLX1dx7qZuplNR2PcZrKtZcRC6w_j_ajRLKntFiO1VVA&_hsmi=77004961)

Advances in computer vision and robotic dexterity may reach the field just in time to save U.S. agriculture from a looming labour shortage. CNN Business surveyed the latest crop of AI-powered farm bots, highlighting those capable of picking tender produce, working long hours, and withstanding outdoor conditions.

Harvest bots tend to use two types of computer vision: one to identify ripe fruits or vegetables, the other to guide the picker.

One major challenge with agricultural robots is adapting them for all-weather conditions, which is very different from building it for factories. The productivity of these robotics is not as equal as humans now. But their production efficiency will gradually increase and have the potential to convert the market from being supply-driven to demand-driven. That will then help to reduce food waste and raise prices.

Sleep is your life-support system and Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality. Sleep scientist Matt Walker shares the wonderfully good things that happen when you get to sleep -- and the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't, for both your brain and body. Learn more about sleep's impact on your learning, memory, immune system and even your genetic code -- as well as some helpful tips for getting some shut-eye.

## Tool
