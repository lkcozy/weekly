1. [Mapping How People Experience Space](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/9/378)

![Beyond Spatial Proximity—Classifying Parks and Their Visitors in London Based on Spatiotemporal and Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_lossy,ret_img,w_900/https://www.gislounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/park-tweets-gis.png)

Spatial analysis and sentiment is a potential important for policy and gauging how people experience space. For instance, in a recent study on how parks affected sentiments of people, data from Twitter showed that people typically tweeted within 3-4 kilometers from a park's center of activity and that parks largely created more positive feeling and attitudes. This suggested to the researchers that creating green spaces and parks near where people lived had a clear mental health benefit and overall positive perception of where people lived.

2. [Best Practices for Geo-Enabling Elections](https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/BestPractices-ES.pdf)

![](../images/issue-8-1.png)

National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) released Best Practices for Geo-Enabling Elections, aimed at decision-makers in elections management across the nation, Monday. The guidance, developed in collaboration with ten states and subject matter experts from both elections and GIS fields, is the result of a two-year project focused on reducing election errors. The best practices can be found in an eight-page executive summary, accompanied by a more detailed document that includes policy and technical considerations.

3. [True cost of living in the United States](https://howmuch.net/articles/true-cost-living)

![](https://howmuch.net/images/affordability-map-landing/anim-gif-desktop.gif)

There are many costs of living rankings out there, but most of them give cost of living averages for the "average American household." Here's the issue - the "average American household" doesn't exist. Income and expenses vary widely between a single millennial to a household of two parents and three kids. This cost tool explores the costs and expenses of living in a place based on your own, specific needs. The True Cost of Living tool allows you to add details like household size, income, occupation, and even food preferences.

4. [Global Forest Watch Fires](https://fires.globalforestwatch.org/map/)

Global Forest Watch Fires (GFW Fires) is an online platform for monitoring and responding to forest and land fires using near real-time information. GFW Fires can empower people to combat harmful fires better before they burn out of control and hold accountable those who may have burned forests illegally.

GFW Fires combines real-time satellite data from NASA’s Active Fires system, high-resolution satellite imagery, detailed maps of land cover and concessions for key commodities such as palm oil and wood pulp, weather conditions and air quality data to track fire activity and related impacts in the South East Asia region. GFW Fires also offers on-the-fly analysis to show where fires occur, and help understand who might be responsible.

5. [25 Map Types](https://gisgeography.com/map-types/)

![](https://gisgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Map-Types-Feature-0.png)

The author introduces 25 different map types. It not only includes some traditional map types, such as density-equalizing cartograms, heat maps, and choropleth, but also contains some non-conventional map types like Dorling cartogram, space-time cubes, distributive flow and word maps.

![Dorling cartogram](https://gisgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dorling-Cartogram.png)

The Dorling cartogram uses shapes like circles and rectangles to depict area. By using shapes, it’s easier to recognize patterns. But its main weakness is that you lose its geographic reference. It can get to such a point that you don’t know what you’re looking at.

![Space-time cubes](https://gisgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Space-time-cubes.jpg)

Space-Time cubes are slices of time stacked up in a three-dimensional space. Older time cubes are on the bottom. New slices of time are on top. So they’re ideal for showing how values change in geographic space. For usability, it takes time to get accustomed to it. But in terms of 4D mapping techniques, it’s one of a kind.

![Distributive flow](https://gisgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Distributive-Flow.png)

Distributive flow maps curl like fingers branching off to their destination depicting direction and movement. Although it’s not necessarily the accurate route being travelled, it’s an abstract way how commodities or information goes from an origin to multiple destinations.

![Word (typography) maps](https://gisgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Word-Maps-0.png)

Word maps assign dominant keywords to features filling in the area of the map. Word placement is key for this type of map in terms of rotation, scaling and skewing. Large words suggest an important topic, whereas small words put less emphasis on a keyword.

## AI

1.[Quantum Supremacy](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2217347-google-claims-it-has-finally-reached-quantum-supremacy/)

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/90U_SmKyfGI/maxresdefault.jpg)

A leaked paper from Google’s quantum computing lab claims “supremacy” over conventional computers. The paper contains details of a quantum processor called Sycamore that contains 54 superconducting quantum bits, or qubits. Google uses the Sycamore to determine whether sets of randomly generated numbers were truly random. Researchers estimate that it would have taken the world’s fastest conventional supercomputer, IBM’s Summit, 10,000 years to solve the problem. Sycamore solved it in 3 minutes and 20 seconds, an early demonstration of the capability known as quantum supremacy.

Instead of bits, quantum computers process information using qubits that can hold the values 1 and 0 simultaneously. A major challenge is keeping quantum processors cold enough to prevent ambient heat from disturbing the fragile qubits.

Quantum computing’s promise of exponentially faster processing, in particular applications, has many in the AI community excited to apply it to tasks like search and pattern matching. The technology works, but it will be a while before actual users can climb aboard.

Basketball coaches often sketch plays on a whiteboard to help players get the ball through the net. A new AI model predicts how opponents would respond to these tactics. A team of researchers trained a conditional generative adversarial network to show how players on the opposing team likely would move in response to human-drafted plays.

The researchers built a two-dimensional simulation of a half-court complete with a three-point line and a net. A coach can draw motion paths for five players represented by dots, as well as ball movements, including passes and shots. No dunking, however. Once a coach has drawn a play, a generator determines how the five defensive players would react. A discriminator evaluates these movements to make sure they match realistic gameplay. The model then displays the coach's play and the defensive maneuvers.

A cohort of NBA pros, basketball fans, and basketball non-fans evaluated the generated defences for realism. While the non-pro fans and non-fans had a hard time spotting the computer’s defensive plays, the NBA pros could tell they were not designed by a human coach.
