1. [U.S. Landslide Inventory Map](https://usgs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ae120962f459434b8c904b456c82669d)

The USGS has launched an online web map that compiles existing United States landslide data into a searchable tool called the U.S. Landslide Inventory Map. This new tool marks the first time a U.S. government agency has attempted to aggregate landslide data from a range of federal, state, and local government agencies into one federated application.

The map displays point and polygon data colour coded by the confidence of individual landslide. Users can search geographically to see available landslide information for a specific area. Clicking on a landslide yields a window with metadata about the source and available details for that event.

One challenging problem for countries to meet the United Nation’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) is a lack of access to relevant geospatial data. The UN is often underfunded, and countries do not have the resources to not only collect data but to ensure their quality.

Recently, the UN has turned to major private companies, such as Google and Alibaba, to help countries reach their development goals. Where these companies can help is particularly with geospatial data that can be used to monitor a variety of different SDGs. The new initiative, called Data for Now, will see the linkage of Google Earth satellite data with UN data. The data will also include phone data that can be used to assess food insecurity or health provision in rural regions. Data can be used to track individuals or monitor land use land cover change in relation to climate change and land use policy in potentially vulnerable countries.

3. [Hunger Map](https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-and-alibaba-unveil-next-generation-machine-learning-technology-fight-against-hunger)

Alibaba Group and the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) will launch a digital map to track food-security issues across the globe.

The Hunger Map LIVE will bring together publicly available information on food security, nutrition, conflict, weather and macro-economic data to show a holistic picture of the food security situation, using machine-learning technology to make informed predictions on food security even in areas where data is currently limited, according to a release. Advanced data-visualization tools then display the information on an interactive map at the global, country and sub-national levels.

## AI/ML

1. [AI Interview System](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/09/27/ai-facial-recognition-used-first-time-job-interviews-uk-find/)

Unilever is using AI technology to analyze the language, tone and facial expressions of a candidate when they are asked a set of identical job questions which they film on their mobile phone or laptop. The algorithm selects the best applicants by assessing their performances in the video against about 25,000 pieces of facial and linguistic information compiled from previous of those who have gone on to prove to be good at the job.

Hirevue, the company that developed the technology, claims it enables hiring firms to interview more candidates in the initial state rather than simply relying on CVs, and that provides a more reliable and objective indicator of future performance free of human bias. Its technology has been used in 100,000 interviews in the UK.

2. [Deep Learning Tackles Skin Ailments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05382.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=77870529&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--6D5bF-9kDsLpQYaSJ-ipxuhfM4TJYGy-1qePATHK-ErgwjsrMCuyybpfU0gPLDI3jBX2polQPUfROfOgNX_1ZB6H8vQ&_hsmi=77870529)

Skin conditions are the fourth-largest cause of nonfatal disease worldwide, but access to dermatological care is sparse. A new study shows that a neural network can do front-line diagnostics work. Researchers trained a model to examine patient records and predict the likelihood of 26 common skin diseases. The researchers believe that their system could improve the diagnostics performance of primary-care centers for skin disease.

The system is designed to mimic the typical diagnostic process in a teledermatology setting. It accepts a patient's medical history and up to six images and returns a differential diagnosis or a ranked list of likely diagnoses.

The model classified diseases more accurately than primary care physicians and nurse practitioners. Allow three guesses, and it was more accurate than dermatologists by 10 percent. The system proved robust to skin colour and type, and its performance remained consistent across variations.

Every home is different. That makes it difficult for domestic robots to translate skills learned in one household -- say, fetching a soda from the fridge -- into another. Training in virtual reality, where the robot has access to rich information about three-dimensional objects and spaces, can make it easier for robots to generalize skills to the real world.

Toyota Research Institute built a household robot that users can train using a virtual reality interface. The robot learns a new behaviour based on a single instance of VR guidance. Then it responds to voice commands to carry out the behaviour in a variety of real-world environments. The robot achieved an 85% success rate at executing some simple moving objects tasks, though it took an average 20 times longer than a human would.

The World Health Organization estimates that 22 percent of the world's population will be over 60 years old by 2050. Who will care for the elderly? Robots may be part of the answer.

## Comments

The best engineers are not the ones that write the most code but are instead making decisions that reduce the amount of code that needs to be written in the future.

For the most part, the closer an engineer is to the problem, the better the overall solution. This is also a big reason why startups can out-build larger companies. They have fewer layers of translations between the problem and the product that’s meant to solve it.

Technology is just a means to an end. Unless IP is what you are selling, boring is great. I’ve seen SO many teams burn SO much energy on complicated stacks to drink kool-aid. It’s mind-bogglingly frustrating, especially as a contractor. But deep down, I want projects to succeed, and clean/sound systems architecture is how you do that. It doesn’t matter if it’s PHP, Python or Java.
