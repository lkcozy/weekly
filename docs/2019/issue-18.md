Mapillary is the `street-level imagery platform` that scales and automates mapping using collaboration, cameras, and computer vision. Mapillary combines images from any camera into a visualization of the world that generates map data for improving maps, developing cities, and progressing the automotive industry. Mapillary's tools enable anyone to collect, share, and use street-level images.

Mapillary works on the principle that anyone can capture and use street-level images. By sharing data on a collaborative platform, everyone wins. And as the need for up-to-date maps keeps growing, computer vision is the key to scaling up map data generation. Here is a summary of how the system works.

The images on Mapillary are available for anyone to explore. The images and the data extracted from them can be used by mapmakers, cities, transport agencies, logistics and delivery companies, automotive companies, humanitarian organizations, NGOs, and anyone else who needs geospatial information from street-level images.

A reactive database framework. Build powerful React and React Native apps that scale from hundreds to tens of thousands of records and remain fast ⚡️.

4. [immutable](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js)

Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures, including List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record.

```js
const { Map } = require("immutable");
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = map1.set("b", 50);
map1.get("b") + " vs. " + map2.get("b"); // 2 vs. 50
```

react-spring is a spring-physics-based animation library that should cover most of your UI-related animation needs. It gives you tools flexible enough to cast your ideas into moving interfaces confidently.

## Resources

1. [101 NumPy Exercises for Data Analysis (Python)](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-numpy-exercises-python/)

The goal of the numpy exercises is to serve as a reference and get you to apply numpy beyond the basics. The questions are four levels of difficulties, with L1 being the easiest to L4 being the hardest.

2. [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)

3. [How to Lose Time and Money](http://paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html)

With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to protect you. So nature and nurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence.

The most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.

## Comments

1. Pick the fastest-growing company you can find. When you're young, care more about building human quickly and not so much about financial capital. Go where other intelligent people are.

2. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work.
