Mapbox Atlas allows you to run Mapbox global maps on your own infrastructure.

2. [Countries that have not been invaded by Britain](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9653497/British-have-invaded-nine-out-of-ten-countries-so-look-out-Luxembourg.html)

A new study has found that at various times the British have invaded almost 90 percent of the countries around the world and only 22 which have never experienced an invasion by the British.

3. [Using DeepVGI to Map Human Settlements](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/15/1799)

The scarce availability of accurate and up-to-date human settlement data remains a major challenge. In recent research, a method that deploys DeepVGI, a classification method using multi-layer recursive learning, and crowdsourcing from geo-tagged images on MapSwipe, a popular map crowdsourcing site, are used together. In this case, DeepVGI classifies urban and non-urban spaces and designates spaces into given categories. Crowdsourcing by those in communities helps to validate and identify other features not easily identified on satellite imagery.

## AI/ML

1. [The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Firefighting](https://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-firefighting.html#gref)

The Assistant for Understanding Data through Reasoning, Extraction and Synthesis, or AUDREY for short, is a software application being developed by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. AUDREY performs data fusion and provides tailored situational awareness to first responders. When first responders are attending an emergency, AUDREY can be an extra set of eyes and ears with a perfect memory and the ability to see through smoke, fire, and heat to augment their capabilities and their natural senses.

## Research

1. [Biosensor Tattos](https://www.sciencealert.com/there-is-now-an-actual-tattoo-that-can-change-colour-based-on-glucose-levels)

Scientists in Germany have developed a different colour-changing dye which could change colour in response to changing levels of glucose, albumin, or pH.

It only been tested on a piece of pig skin, and haven't yet been tested in humans. But it could lead to real tattoos that let patients and doctor monitor chronic diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease in real-time.

2. [3D-Printed Skin and Bone](https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Upside-down_3D-printed_skin_and_bone_for_humans_to_Mars)

![](https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2018/11/3d_bioprinting_for_space/18887672-1-eng-GB/3D_bioprinting_for_space_large.jpg)

Scientists from the University Hospital of Dresden Technical University are working on 3D-printed skin and bone. Skin cells can be bioprinted using human blood plasma while the bone can be produced using human stem cells with the addition of a calcium phosphate bone cement.

This project is developed for travel to Mars or other interplanetary destinations. Because a journey to these places will involve several years in space. A 3D bioprinting capability will let crews respond to medical emergencies as they arise. For instance, brand new skin could be bioprinted in the case of burns.

## Tool

1. [mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper)

Tools for editing Shapefile, GeoJSON, TopoJSON and CSV files. The `mapshaper` command line program supports essential map making tasks like simplifying shapes, editing attribute data, filtering and more. The web UI version supports interactive editing operation.

2. [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/index.html)

![](https://www.pulumi.com/images/infographics@2x.jpg)

Pulumi is an open source platform for building and deploying cloud infrastructure and applications in your favorite language on any cloud.

3. [TabNine](https://tabnine.com/)
