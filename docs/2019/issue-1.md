Koop is an open-source GeoSpatial ETL engine that allows anyone to transform, query, and download geospatial data on the web. It can be extended to translate data from any source to any API specification.

2. [Map with AI](https://tech.fb.com/ai-is-supercharging-the-creation-of-maps-around-the-world/)

It's usually very slow to create map manually. It requires a huge investment to identify roads, highways, bridges, etc. Facebook released an AI-powered mapping tool, called RapiD, which can automatically generate maps from satellite imagery. In the above picture, the white lines are the existing roads, and the pink lines are roads identified by AI.

The tool can even recognize the riverside trails and is therefore particularly useful in rural areas which the map data is incomplete and difficult to map on the ground.

Map with AI has complemented the existing roads in Thailand and Indonesia with missing maps, increasing the total road mileage of the road of Thailand from 280,000 miles to 600,000 miles. It just took only 18 months instead of 3 to 5 years by traditional means.

The “Movement data in GIS” series discusses all things related to working with movement data aka. trajectories in GIS, covering concepts, libraries, desktop GIS, databases, and big data technology. A trajectory is, or more correctly has, a time-ordered series of geometries. Raw unsegmented streams of movement data, as well as semantically meaningful subsections or other subsections, can therefore be represented as trajectories. Depending on the use case, the trajectory object can access a point-based or a line-based representation of its data.

4. [MovingPandas](https://github.com/anitagraser/movingpandas)

MovingPandas implements a Trajectory class and corresponding methods based on GeoPandas.

5. [Towards a Semantically Enriched Local Dynamical Map](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_257396.pdf)

![](../images/issue-1-1.png)
This paper presented a semantically enriched Local Dynamical Map that applies ontologies and spatial stream databases.

![](../images/issue-1-2.png)

Local Dynamic Map (LDM) consists of the following four layers:
(1) Permanent static: The first layer contains static information obtained from GIS maps that include roads, intersections, and points-of-interests (POIS);
(2) Transient static: The second layer extends the static map by further traffic attributes, fixed Intelligent Transport Systems stations, landmarks, and intersection features like more detailed topological lane data;
(3) Transient dynamic: The third layer contains temporary regional information like weather, road or traffic conditions (e.g., traffic jams), and traffic light signal phases;
(4) The fourth layer contains dynamic information, mainly vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure messages of road users, including their GPS position and speed.

6. [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)

Kepler.gl is a powerful open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets. The key advantage of the platform is that it can provide complex and informative visualization using a massive amount of data, making it a stable and useful for people who interest in big data visualization and mapping.

7. [Planet Analytics](https://www.planet.com/products/analytics/)

Planet Analytics is a platform from the satellite imagery provider that provides road detection, building detection, and vessel detection & tracking.

## AI/ML

1.[Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByvPp5xGL1I&amp=&t=2569s)

Our lives are full of making decisions under uncertainty. Uncertainty constrains strategy. Prediction is at the heart of making such decisions. Better prediction creates better opportunities for new business structures and strategies to compete. Prediction tool increases productivity.

The impact of AI will be profound, but the economic framework for understanding it is surprisingly simple.

2.[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)

The fastai library simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices.

3. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

![](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.dribbble.com%2Fusers%2F1655169%2Fscreenshots%2F3953530%2Fhira-google-collab-mock.jpg&f=1)

Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment. It allows you to write and execute code, share your analyses, and access powerful computing resources, from your browser. You can even develop deep learning application with free GPU.

## Research

1. [Sleep](https://time.com/4651743/insomnia-sleep-therapy/)

![](https://saneinbox.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/michael-grandner1.jpg)

Get out of bed when you're not asleep. This is the best tip Dr. Michael Grandner can give. After decades of research, he found counter-intuitive advice. The reason is that beds are designed to make it easy to sleep, but if we can't sleep, that makes the bed's impact weaker.

This method won't work 100% of the time, but it will work more than most people think.
