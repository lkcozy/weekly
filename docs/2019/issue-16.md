![](https://handsondataviz.org/images/13-transform/mapshaper-edit-annotated.png)

Mapshaper is software for editing Shapefile, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, CSV and several other data formats written in JavaScript.

Mapshaper supports essential map-making tasks like `simplifying shapes, editing attribute data, clipping, erasing, dissolving, filtering and more.

Mapshaper includes several command-line programs, which can be run under Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.

- `mapshaper` Runs mapshaper commands.
- `mapshaper-xl` Works the same as mapshaper, but runs with more RAM to support larger files.
- `mapshaper-gui` Runs the mapshaper Web interface locally.

2. [Determining Uncertainty in GIS Data](https://www.gislounge.com/determining-uncertainty-in-gis-data/)

Uncertainty is an unavoidable part of spatial data due to an approximation of real-world phenomena. Moreover, many real-world decision-makings involve uncertainty due to the unpredictable and unknowable nature of the problem.

Spatial decision-making is subjected to uncertainty due to its operations, including discretization and generalization on the geographical data set. The influence of uncertainty may be visible in original data and measurement, assumptions, or the model structure.

An uncertainty analysis helps us to define and understand the possible sources. Following an uncertainty analysis, a sensitivity analysis completes the picture by enabling us to relate the amount of uncertainty and its relation to input variables. The potential sources of uncertainty could be multiple; however, criteria weights are usually considered the foremost source of controversy and certainty in MCE.

[In this article](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-GIS-Based-Sensitivity-Analysis-of-Multi-Criteria-Yu-Shahbaz/479ff1f96b0bbce1fa87ff49e0f6398e160446d5?p2df) the most outstanding application of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis possibilities of MCE can be discussed under renewable energy site selection, land-use evaluation and flood vulnerability.

3. [Sunset Geometry]()

If the earth were flat, photographs of the sun setting over water would look like this:

Actual photographs of the sun setting over calm water look more like this:

Notice the shortened reflection. This happens because of `the curvature of the earth`, and by measuring the size of this effect, it is possible to `infer the ratio of the earth’s radius to the camera’s height above the water`.

## AI

1. [Deep Learning Do It Yourself!](https://dataflowr.github.io/website/)

This site collects resources to learn Deep Learning in Modules available through the sidebar on the left. As a student, you can walk through the modules at your own pace and interact with others, thanks to the associated digital platforms.

## Research

1. [Robot-assisted brain surgery](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-toronto-doctors-perform-first-robot-assisted-brain-surgery-on-live/)

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b7e6a86d310db37e0dc42325cb80e59bd06b2127c48d90540c2420938bdd5461/68747470733a2f2f7777772e77616e67626173652e636f6d2f626c6f67696d672f61737365742f3230313931312f6267323031393131303730332e6a7067)

Toronto doctors have performed their first robot-assisted brain surgery on a live patient, testing a system they believe will allow them to operate remotely on stroke and aneurysm patients shortly.

The team at the University Health Network guided a robot Friday to place a stent and 14 coils deep inside the brain of a 64-year-old woman to treat an aneurysm.

The procedure took about 2½ hours. The patient was discharged the following day and was doing well.

`The potential for using surgical robots to perform remote neurovascular therapies would have a great impact `in countries like Canada, with a limited number of specialists and a population spread over a vast area.

## Tool

1. [Blitz](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz)

The fullstack React framework built on Next.js. Blitz adds all the missing features and functionality that turns Next into a true full-stack framework. These key features include direct database access, middleware, and authentication.

2. [On the direction of React performance optimization](https://developpaper.com/on-the-direction-of-react-performance-optimization/)

![](https://imgs.developpaper.com/imgs/vl.png)

The author shares several react performance optimization tips from three directions:

- reduce the amount of calculation
- using cache
- precise recalculation range

3. [Node.js Best Practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices#1-project-structure-practices)

![](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/raw/master/assets/images/banner-2.jpg)

- Structure your solution by self-contained components
- Separate component code into layers: web, services, and Data Access Layer (DAL)
- Wrap common utilities as npm packages
- Use environment aware, secure and hierarchical config
- Use multi-stage builds for leaner and more secure Docker images

4. [Rebase Considered HarmfulLogin](https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/rebaseharm.md)

The author thought the rebasing is an anti-patten and recommended not to use the git rebase command, not on branches developed by multiple people. It is dishonest. It deliberately omits historical information. It causes problems for collaboration. And it has no offsetting benefits.

## Comments

1. “Do it fast” is more important than “do it well.” What we need is to make as many achievements as possible at a low cost, rather than create a fine product at a high cost. Perfectionism can get in the way of “doing it fast.”.
   --[ruanyf](https://github.com/ruanyf/weekly/blob/master/docs/issue-86.md)

2. By striving for perfection, I created unrealistic expectations from myself without even realizing it. Perfectionism eats away our most precious resource, time, which takes your attention away from your real priorities.

3. Deploying something useless into production as soon as you can, is the right way to start a new project. It pulls unknown risk forward, opens up parallel streams of work, and establishes good habits.
