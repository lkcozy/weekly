## GeoSpatial

1. [Hexagon Mobile Alert Bundle](https://hexagongeospatial.force.com/mappexchange/#/apps/a0q6A000000a0vXQAQ)

Mobile Alert Viewer displays, in real-time, the incidents reported by citizens in the configured area. It uses the latitude and longitude of each incident to plot its location on the map. By selecting an incident marker, you can view the details about each incident (type, identifier, address, comment). Using the interactive charts, you can easily see the number of incidents per hour or month, filter incidents by categories or transform the detailed dynamic report to a CSV file.

Mobile Alert Configurator assists in defining the core Mobile Alert application configuration parameters: configuration name and purpose, area of interest, incident categories and their graphics representation, email notifications, as well as access credentials to the Mobile Alert Viewer for authorized access to the comprehensive view of reported incidents. All of this is done in five easy steps with no GIS or IT knowledge required. Moreover, the configuration can be updated at any time and is immediately reflected in all Mobile Alert mobile applications being used in the selected area of interest.

A single system drives deeper insights, proactive management and optimisation of rail networks. Clearly identify availability, punctuality, capacity, speed restrictions, interruptions and deviations all within a single interface.

Create, triage, assign and track faults through their life cycle, decreasing total time to restore and improving visibility for all stakeholders.

Maintenance staff are armed with the shared knowledge and history of assets in their Smart device. With its real-time functionality, the WillowRail app allows network owners and maintainers to view fault location, asset details, progress of repair and actions executed by maintenance staff all while having a direct line of communication, streamlining processes.

3. [THE 2019 DRIVING CITIES INDEX](https://www.mister-auto.co.uk/driving-cities-index/)

![](../images/issue-12-1.png)

All scores are out of 100, where the higher the score, the better, with the exception of the Road Rage Score, where the lower the score, the fewer the incidents.

Mister Auto publishes the 2019 driving cities index by analyzing hundreds of cities' driving related data. From infrastructure and congestion, to driver behaviour, their comprehensive study takes a deeper look into cities which are successfully utilising infrastructure and legislation to improve conditions for vehicle users.

15 parameters that are most important to making a city a good place to drive, are divided into three categories: infrastructure, safety and costs. To determine a city's infrastructure, they examined factors such as the number of cars per capita, traffic congestion , road and public transport quality, among others. Next, they researched air quality levels in order to determine the city's commitment to providing fresh air and good visibility for its drivers and citizens alike.

Next, the safety of each location was analyzed by the car accident fatality rate as well as conducting a poll focusing on incidents of road rage, in order to paint a picture of the aggressiveness and general driving culture brought to the city by motorists.

Finally, they looked at the costs associated with driving in each city, including not only at the price of combustibles and annual road tax paid in each location, but also the purchase parity of each country to determine how affordable driving was for its inhabitants.

The final index combine a total of 15 factors to reveal the best and worst cities for car owners to drive-in across the globe.

4. [Twelve Million Phones, One Dataset, Zero Privacy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html)

EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY, everywhere on the planet, dozens of companies — largely unregulated, little scrutinized — are logging the movements of tens of millions of people with mobile phones and storing the information in gigantic data files. The Times Privacy Project obtained one such file, by far the largest and most sensitive ever to be reviewed by journalists. It holds more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans as they moved through several major cities, including Washington, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Each piece of information in this file represents the precise location of a single smartphone over a period of several months in 2016 and 2017. The data was provided to Times Opinion by sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share it and could face severe penalties for doing so. The sources of the information said they had grown alarmed about how it might be abused and urgently wanted to inform the public and lawmakers.

5. [Power of Siberia gas pipeline](https://www.quora.com/How-will-the-power-of-Siberia-gas-pipeline-that-Putin-and-Xi-just-launched-affect-the-global-energy-industry-and-geopolitics)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-394db6613e3a122c25601d72fd9fc662)

This new Siberia gas pipeline is expected to supply 28% of China’s current gas market, and it has the potential capacity to reach 50%. This is only the “east line”. There is another “west line” in construction, which is expected to go across Western China to reach Shanghai.

The biggest geopolitical impact of this project is that it enables both China & Russia to mitigate strategic risks, in addition to the normal benefits associated with the energy trade (e.g. economic growth for both countries).

For the PRC, this pipeline mitigates the geopolitical risk of supply disruptions. Because the overland pipelines allow the PRC to diversify energy sources, & more importantly, bypass maritime transport routes and China is less vulnerable to supply disruptions, either from tensions with the US, or other unforeseen sources of regional instability.

For Russia, this pipeline diversifies its export customer base. Russia’s economy is heavily dependent on oil & gas exports. Pipelines such as ESPO & Power of Siberia enables Russia to capture the Chinese market at scale, & reduce its relative economic dependence on the West.

In sum, the Power of Siberia is a win-win project that helps both countries mitigate their respective strategic vulnerabilities & boost economic growth.

2. [Winnow](https://www.winnowsolutions.com/)

![](https://www.winnowsolutions.com/hubfs/giphy.gif)

Winnow produces digital tools to help chefs measure, monitor, and reduce food waste. It uses the AI based-solution to help chefs run more profitable and sustainable kitchens by cutting food waste in half.

The system is composed of three components.(1) A camera that automatically takes pictures of the bin as food is thrown away; (2) A scale on which the bin is placed that accurately captures the weight of the waste thrown into the bin; (3) the Tablet that connects the kitchen to the cloud and processes the images in real time.

The system takes photos of wasted food as it's thrown away, using the images, the machine trains itself to recognize what has been thrown in the bin. At the first stage, a state of semi-automation is reached where users are only required to confirm the suggested food. Once trained, full automation will not require any input from the team. Users receive regular reports that highlight the volume, value, and environment impact of the waste. From their tests, it can save an average of \$35,000 per year.

3. [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse)

![Row-oriented DBMS](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/images/row_oriented.gif)

![Column-oriented DBMS](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/images/column_oriented.gif)

ClickHouse is a column-oriented database management system (DBMS) for online analytical processing of queries (OLAP).

Input/output

- For an analytical query, only a small number of table columns need to be read. In a column-oriented database, you can read just the data you need. For example, if you need 5 columns out of 100, you can expect a 20-fold reduction in I/O.
- Since data is read in packets, it is easier to compress. Data in columns is also easier to compress. This further reduces the I/O volume.
- Due to the reduced I/O, more data fits in the system cache.
