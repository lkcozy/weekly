Last month, a 6-year-old boy, Ethan, went missing on a subfreezing night in Sherburne County, Minnesota. A group of roughly 600 people showed up to search for Ethan and his dog but found nothing. A photographer learned this search at 8 pm and arrived on site about 9 pm. He arrived carrying his DJI m210RTK v2 drone equipped with an XT2 dual thermal camera. He also had 10-12 sets of batteries charged and started flying to view the heat source on the ground. After quite a few false positives - otters, deer, bear, at 1:40 am, he finally spotted the six-year-old and his dog. A ground rescue team made it to his location and saved the boy and his dog.

The below thermal image shows a stream of volunteers walking a path to find missing 6-year-old Ethan.

To understand the migration trajectory of the endangered steppe eagles, Russian scientists had put tracking devices on them, and SIM card inside the device will send a message report position at regular intervals.

At the beginning of October, scientists rang the alarm when several eagles left Kazakhstan and about to enter the Iran and Pakistan area, where the mobile phone signal will become International roaming. The cost of SMS will be super-expensive, which are costing 49 rubles each (\$1.12) instead of the usual price of 2 to 15 rubles.

These Russian Scientists started a crowdfunding campaign and received enough money to monitor these 17 eagles for a year.

Scientists claim to have traced the ancestral home region of all living humans to a vast wetland that sprawled over much of modern-day Botswana and served as an oasis in an otherwise parched expanse of Africa.

The swathe of land south of the Zambezi River became a thriving home to Homo sapiens 200,000 years ago, the researchers suggested and sustained an isolated, founder population of modern humans for at least 70,000 years.

The group remained in the region until a shift in the climate, driven by changes in the Earth’s tilt and orbit, brought rains to the north-east and south-west, producing lush green corridors that allowed the early humans to spread into new territories, the scientists say.

According to a data company, there were 22.3 million software engineers worldwide in 2018

The United States currently has the largest population of software developers. But the top nation for growth in China. China has 1.9 million software developers, and the growth rate is between 6% to 8%, leading up to 2023. India's developers' population will overtake the US by 2023.

Whether you are looking for a fun family project, a teaching resource or want something exciting and unique to decorate your home or office with these printable globes are just the things. The graphic on each world is not just a pretty picture, made from real topographic data, and each world is a great way of exploring our earth.

The globes are designed to be printed in A3, but A4 is fine too. But generally, the bigger they are the easier they are to fold! Especially with the more complicated designs. A thin black line marks each fold line.

The 2019 Fall Foliage Map is the ultimate visual planning guide to the annual progressive changing of the leaves. While no tool can be 100% accurate, this tool is meant to help travellers better time their trips to have the best opportunity of catching peak colour each year.

1. A demographic shift that reconfigures modern economies.
2. Wealth inequality that’s grown for four decades hits an inevitable breaking point.
3. Access to information closes gaps that used to create a social shield of ignorance.

Tail events drive the world. A minority of things drive the majority of outcomes. It’s one of the most important concepts in investing, where a few positions may account for most of your life returns.

Demographics, inequality, and information access will have a significant impact on the coming decades. How those Big Things end is a story yet to be told. But when it’s said we’ll have a better idea of where it began.
