## GeoSpatial

1. [GroudWork](https://groundwork.azavea.com/)

![](https://groundwork.azavea.com/assets/img/groundwork-hero-viz.png)

A free image labelling tool for creating custom training datasets from satellite imagery. Groundwork converts .tif files that you upload into Cloud-Optimized GeoTiffs (COGs) and stores vector annotations as GeoJSON. You can export your annotated training dataset as a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) at any time, making it compatible with a growing ecosystem of Python libraries, like PySTAC and Franklin.

2. [Antipodes Map](https://www.antipodesmap.com/)

This map helps you find the antipodes (the other side of the world) of any place on Earth.

The `Left` Map presents the place for which you want to find the antipodal point.`The`Right`Map shows the`antipodal point` for the left map's selected location.

Type in the search box the country, city, address, zip code or geographical coordinates, press the Find button and our "man" will dig a tunnel from the selected location on the Left Map, right through the center of the Earth, up to the other side of the world which will be represented on Right Map.

Both maps can be moved and zoomed in and out. Below each map, you can view the selected location address and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

> Latitude: the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and the center of the Earth.
> Longitude is the angle east or west from a reference meridian to another meridian that passes through the point.

The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain. The archive is located in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago, closer to the North Pole than the Arctic Circle. GitHub will capture every active public repository snapshot on 02/02/2020 and preserve that data in the Arctic Code Vault.

## Comments

1. The overwhelming majority of any successful products feature development is post-launch, with new features only being considered complete once they are deployed into production. A team that gets into the groove of regular, post-launch practices early is setting itself up for sustainable success.
