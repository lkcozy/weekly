1. [Second Sight](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/soundscape/)

Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research Laboratory offers a free iPhone app called Soundscape, which gives sightless pedestrians the ability to navigate by ear.

How it works:
It is essentially a navigation app. But unlike conventional navigation apps that issue a direction to a destination. Soundscape narrates points of interest along the way. That helps people who don't see well to explore as a sighted person can.

- Soundscape interprets a phone's GPS signals and accelerometer to determine the user's location, trajectory and facing direction. It pulls labels from a map to describe the surrounding environment.
- Then it speaks these descriptions in stereo. If the user approaches a crosswalk on the right, they'll hear about it in their right ear. If the user passes a store on the left, the narrator's voice sounds in their left ear.

2. [Pozyx](https://www.pozyx.io/)

Pozyx is hardware/software real-time locating system solution that provides accurate positioning and motion information with sub-meter accuracy(10 cm). Pozyx leverages ultra-wideband(UWB) technology. The accuracy achieved with UWB technology is several times better than traditional positioning systems. The UWB signal is very robust and can penetrate thin walls. This makes Pozyx also suitable for the various challenging indoor environment.

3. [Tracker for ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/arcnews/tracker-for-arcgis-streamlines-fieldwork-management/)

There is often a disconnect, however, between what is happening in the field and what is going on in the office, and that can leave managers and supervisors uncertain of where their field resources are at any given time. Historically, fieldwork-heavy organizations have used work tickets, two-way radios, and other tools to help bridge this divide. But getting a real-time understanding of where field personnel are has always been difficult and expensive.

Tracker for ArcGIS, a newly introduced app from Esri, allows field personnel to share their real-time locations using a mobile app for iOS and Android devices. The track data enables supervisors and managers to identify a user's last known location and also perform after-action analysis.

4. [Easy2Hike](https://corp.easy2hike.com/)

The Easy2Hike app shares up-to-date information on park conditions and potential hazards, and it's made available offline for users in areas with low cell reception. Hikers, bikers, and equestrians use it to plan park visits, enhance their hiking experiences, and learn more about their surroundings while out on the trail. Besides, park rangers use the app to share updated park information and engage with visitors.

5. [ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/overview)

![](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/en-us/arcgis/products/storymaps-2019/50-50-simple-mapmaking.jpg)

ArcGIS StoryMaps allows you to create inspiring, immersive stories by combining interactive maps, text, and other multimedia content. StoryMaps makes it easy to harness the power of maps and geography to tell the story.

6. [Mapping the Most Pleasant Pedestrian Route](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/11/3794)

Most of us are concerned about getting somewhere, usually as fast as possible, so we are accustomed to using Google Maps or similar tools we prefer for navigation to find the quickest route possible. However, we may not always want to find simply the fastest route. There are health, physical, enjoyable and even economic reasons as to why the quickest way is not optimal. Furthermore, along the route, there are other things we may prefer, such as finding places to socialize or even being surrounded by peace. New tools are beginning to make the task of finding such routes easier for us.

One new pedestrian tool, using OpenStreetMap (OSM), applies this approach, where it factors street networks for their noise, pollution, sociability, and general pleasantness, including shade from trees. The tool aggregates these factors and allows users to customize choices to find routes that best fit their needs (e.g., lack of noise, more green space, presence of social places such as cafes, etc.).

7. [iSTAR Pulsar](https://www.gislounge.com/next-generation-asset-management-with-istar-pulsar/)

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/onestopvr-react/landingPage/image/woman2.jpg)

iSTAR Pulsar is a 'big data' capture device developed in collaboration with Google, Intel and Sony for 360-degree virtualization. It has 4 x pre‚Äêcalibrated sensors synchronized to deliver a highly accurate 50MP spherical image with excellent high dynamic range (HDR). The system can be vehicle, drone, or backpack mounted to capture data everywhere. It is also designed for ease of use and does not require any photography experience or even a computer to operate. The iSTAR Pulsar app provides the ability to plan routes, as well as to view and share content online.

Alex Honnold shows his unique ability to remain calm and analytical through climbing the EI Capitan without using ropes or other safety gear. To some degree, the risk is manageable as long as you consider every possibility and rehearse enough to remove all doubt. Feeling fearful is not helping you anyway. It's only hindering your performance, so keep practicing until everything you do is automatic.

## Tool

1. [FlatGeobuf](https://github.com/bjornharrtell/flatgeobuf)

![](https://github.com/bjornharrtell/flatgeobuf/raw/master/doc/layout.svg?sanitize=true)

A performant binary encoding for geographic data based on faltbuffers. Its goals are to be suitable for large volumes of static data, significantly faster than legacy formats without size limitations for contents and to be ideal for streaming access. The data can be clustered on a packed Hilbert R-Tree, which enables fast bounding box spatial filtering.

2. [echarts-countries-js](https://github.com/echarts-maps/echarts-countries-js)

It collects all geojsons in javascript of 213 countries and regions and acts as a static asset to jupyter-echarts or your ECharts collection.
