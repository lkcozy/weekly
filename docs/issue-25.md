[How You Should Read Research Papers According To Andrew Ng (Stanford Deep Learning Lectures)](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-you-should-read-research-papers-according-to-andrew-ng-stanford-deep-learning-lectures-98ecbd3ccfb3)

Instructions on how to approach knowledge acquisition through published research papers by a recognized figure within the world of machine learning and education

A guide will provide you within instructions on how to go through a research paper effectively:

- A systematic approach to reading a collection of papers to gain knowledge within a domain
- How to properly read a research paper
- Useful online resources that can aid you in searching for papers and key information

- Assemble collections of resources that focus on the subject matter.
  - Resources can come in the form of research papers, Medium articles, blog posts, videos, GitHub repository etc.
- Conduct a deep dive of any resource you deem relevant to the subject matter.
  - It is crucial that there’s a method to track the understanding of each shortlisted resources. Andrew Ng, suggests a table of resource plotted against your understanding level that looks similar to the table below.
  - It is advisable to ensure you go through at least 10–20% of the content of each paper you have added to the list; this will ensure that you have been exposed to enough of the introductory content within an identified resource and are able to gauge its relevancy accurately.
  - For the more relevant papers/resources identified, it is expected that you progress to a higher level of understanding. Eventually, you will have identified some appropriate resources with content that you understand fully.
  - According to Andrew, an understanding of 5–20 papers will showcase a basic understanding within the subject matter, perhaps enough understanding to progress to implementation of techniques.
  - 50–100 papers will primarily provide you with a very good understanding of the domain.

* Take structured notes that summarises the key discoveries, findings and techniques within a paper, in your own words.
  - Reading for the purpose of understanding is not done through one pass of the contents within the paper.
  - Be prepared to go through a paper at least three times to have a good understanding of its content
  - In your first pass, start with reading the following sections within the paper: title, abstract and figures.
  - The second pass entails you reading the following sections: introduction, conclusion, another pass through figures and scan through the rest of the content.
  - The third pass of the paper involves reading the whole sections within the paper but skipping any complicated maths or technique formulations that might be alien to you. During this pass, you can also skip any terms and terminologies that you do not understand or aren’t familiar.
  - Those conducting in-depth research into a domain can take a few more passes. These additional passes will mainly be focused on an understanding of the maths, techniques and unknown terminologies presented within the paper.

- Questions To Ask Yourself

Describe what the authors of the paper aim to accomplish, or perhaps did achieve.
If a new approach/technique/method was introduced in a paper, what are the key elements of the newly proposed approach?
What content within the paper is useful to you?
What other references do you want to follow?
