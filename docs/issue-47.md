Fabric is a new feature introduced in Neo4j 4.0 and is a way to store and retrieve data in multiple databases. This feature makes it easy to query the data in the same DBMS or multiple DBMS using a single Cypher query.

In practical terms, Fabric provides the infrastructure and tooling for:

- **Data Federation**: the ability to access data available in distributed sources in the form of disjointed graphs.
- **Data Sharding**: the ability to access data available in distributed sources in the form of a common graph partitioned on multiple databases.

Fabric is supported from Neo4j 4.x feature,and is an Enterprise Only feature.

1. [AR Cut & Paste](https://github.com/cyrildiagne/ar-cutpaste)

![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisiscolossal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2Fcopy-paste.gif&f=1&nofb=1)

The Paris-based designer and artist Cyril Diagne recently launched a new image editing program that circumvents the traditional method using a single app.

When users take a photograph with AR Cut & Paste, the software finds distinct objects and automatically removes their backgrounds. In a video below, Diagne shows how a plant is captured on a mobile device before being snipped from the surrounding image. Once he hovers over the computer screen, the cut-out plant is placed directly into Photoshop.

## Tool

1. [Classnames](A simple JavaScript utility for conditionally joining classNames together.)

```js
classNames("foo", "bar"); // => 'foo bar'
classNames("foo", { bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'
classNames({ "foo-bar": true }); // => 'foo-bar'
classNames({ "foo-bar": false }); // => ''
classNames({ foo: true }, { bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'
classNames({ foo: true, bar: true }); // => 'foo bar'

// lots of arguments of various types
classNames("foo", { bar: true, duck: false }, "baz", { quux: true }); // => 'foo bar baz quux'

// other falsy values are just ignored
classNames(null, false, "bar", undefined, 0, 1, { baz: null }, ""); // => 'bar 1'
```
