Fabric is a new feature introduced in Neo4j 4.0 and is a way to store and retrieve data in multiple databases. This feature makes it easy to query the data in the same DBMS or multiple DBMS using a single Cypher query.

In practical terms, Fabric provides the infrastructure and tooling for:

- **Data Federation**: the ability to access data available in distributed sources in the form of disjointed graphs.
- **Data Sharding**: the ability to access data available in distributed sources in the form of a common graph partitioned on multiple databases.

Fabric is supported from Neo4j 4.x feature,and is an Enterprise Only feature.
