# GISer's Weekly Issue 88

## GeoSpatial

1. [GeoMQTT](http://www.geomqtt.org/)

![](http://www.geomqtt.org/images/geomqtt_architecture.png)

A publish-subscribe protocol for the geospatial IoT.

MQTT protocol only supports topic filters. GeoMQTT protocol extends the MQTT protocol by adding the spatial filter and temporal filter, which partially moves filter processing from the client-side to the server-side.

2. [Super-resolution Imaging](https://www.gislounge.com/super-resolution-imaging/)

![The process of using super-resolution in enhancing resolution in imagery.](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client2/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1100/https://www.gislounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MapScaping-Rsuper-resolution-upsampling.png)

Super-resolution enhances images using deep learning artificial intelligence. This improves the image's appearance and its usefulness in identifying desired features.

3. [Terrestrial Ecoregions GIS Data](https://www.gislounge.com/terrestrial-ecoregions-gis-data/)

Ecoregions are currently used to split the land on Earth into zones with similar geography. These ecoregions are comparable in terms of geography and ecology, as well as solar radiation and precipitation level. The ecoregion is a concatenation of ecological region. There are 846 ecoregions found on land. These 846 ecoregions are categorized into 14 biomes and eight biogeographic realms. Six of the biomes are forest, and eight are non-forested.

## AI/ML

1. [One Model for Vision-Language](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-94/)

![](https://info.deeplearning.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20-%202021-05-04T162716.343.gif?width=1200&upscale=true&name=ezgif.com-gif-maker%20-%202021-05-04T162716.343.gif)

Researchers have proposed task-agnostic architectures for image classification tasks and language tasks. New work offers a unified architecture for vision-language tasks.

**Why it matters**: A single architecture that can learn several tasks should share concepts between tasks.

**How it works**: Given a text description of a task — say, “describe the image” — and an image, GPV-I generates different representations of the text and image, determines their relative importance to one another, and outputs a relevant text response and a copy of the image with bounding boxes.

## Tool

1. [useSWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr)

React Hooks library for remote data fetching. With SWR, components will get a stream of data updates constantly and automatically. Thus, the UI will always be fast and reactive.

2. [octokit.js](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js)

The all-batteries included GitHub SDK for Browsers, Node.js, and Deno.

3. [git-split-diffs](https://github.com/banga/git-split-diffs)

![](https://github.com/banga/git-split-diffs/raw/main/screenshots/dark.png?raw=true)

GitHub style split diffs with syntax highlighting in your terminal.

4. [Touch Bar System Monitor](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/touchbar-systemmonitor/blob/master/README.md)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spagnuolocarmine/touchbar-systemmonitor/master/screenshots/touchbar_systemmonitor3.gif?token=ACPXSE7ILAQY5H4V4VO2B526OUIEQ)

A better simple reactive system monitor on macOS for your MacBook pro. It was built with Electron.

5. [sqliteviz](https://github.com/lana-k/sqliteviz)

![](https://github.com/lana-k/sqliteviz/wiki/img/Screenshot_result.png?0.13.0)

Sqliteviz is a single-page offline-first PWA for entirely client-side visualization of SQLite databases or CSV files.

6. [hookstate](https://github.com/avkonst/hookstate)

The simple but compelling and swift state management for React that is based on hooks

## Videos

1. [Narakeet](https://www.narakeet.com/docs/script/#more-examples)

![](https://www.narakeet.com/assets/howto/nk-script-screencast-20200829-pic-x304.jpg)

Narakeet makes it easy to script videos using plain text (Markdown) files.

## Resources

1. [You Don't Need GUI](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-GUI)

A curated list of commands to execute everyday tasks which might be tempted to do in GUI.

## Comments

1. It is an error to add measurements that have different units. This puzzle teaches us that the inverse is not true: two measurements that have the same unit attached (dollars, in this case) may still sum to a value that represents nothing meaningful.
   --[Where Did the Other Dollar Go](https://blog.cloudandtree.com/2021/04/the-other-dollar/)

2. Great writing looks effortless. But because the ideas are so clear, casual readers don't appreciate how much time it took to refine them.
   Your work is done when it looks so simple that the consumer thinks they could've done it, which means they won't appreciate how hard you worked.
