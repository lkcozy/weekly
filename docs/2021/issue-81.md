## GeoSpatial

1. [MapBox Static Images API Playground](https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/static/)

`MapBox Static Images API Playground is an interactive image builder with full api support and live preview.`

Before, developers needed to read the API documentation and implement features in code to work with the Static Images API. Now, developers can see how Static Images API responses will look based on the position, resolution, padding, overlays, and style parameters using just a few clicks in the Static Playground.

Developers can test with various inputs, then copy the Static Image API URL directly into mobile apps, emails, or websites to easily add dynamic maps.

2. [The Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Line,_Saudi_Arabia)

The Line is a proposed smart city in Saudi Arabia. It's a 170-km belt of zero-energy walkable communities for a million people. The city would be divided into nodes. All daily services would be reachable within a 5-minute walk. The city will also be powered entirely by renewable energy. AI will monitor for the city and use predictive and data models to figure out ways to improve daily life for citizens.

The Line will consist of three layers, including one on the surface for `pedestrians,` one underground for `infrastructure,` and another underground for `transportation.` The transportation will include a high-speed rail system, which would allow people to go from one side of the city to the other side in just 20 minutes.

At first glance, the design seems unique, but it makes perfect sense when you think about it carefully. Since there is only one main road, public transport can be fully utilized, and there is only one route, which is very efficient. Various utility pipelines need only be built on a single main pipe, with branches on either side.

Humans just got one more reason to journey to outer space. There'sThere's a rare asteroid the size of Massachusetts orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, and it's made entirely of iron and nickel.

## AI/ML

1. [Large Language Models for Chinese](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-87/)

![](https://info.deeplearning.ai/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-06%20at%2010.01.49%20AM%20copy.png)

Four models collectively called `Wu Dao` was described by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence. Wu Dao'sDao's constituent models were developed by over 100 scientists at leading Chinese universities and tech companies.

**Why it matters**: `This effort reflects China'sChina's growing confidence and capability in AI.` Such ambitious projects could also curb China's AI brain drain, as many of its most talented engineers wind up leaving for work overseas.

AI has long been dominated by organizations clustered in a few geographic hotspots. `China's effort to shift AI'sAI's center of gravity away from the west could have far-reaching repercussions into the types of systems that get built and how they're deployed.

## Research

1. [Buildings made with fungi could live, grow — and then biodegrade](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-mycelium-fungi-building-1.5963938)

![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.5963983.1616694335!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/mycelium-wall.jpg)

Canadian scientists try to use mycelium, a material made from fungi, as a greener substitute for foam insulation.

Mycelium can be grown by humans from waste materials such as sawdust or agricultural residues such as plant stalks and husks, recycling them and generating a new product within weeks in a low-cost, low-energy process compared to traditional manufacturing.

Mycelium can even be grown to a particular shape, similar to the way concrete is cast. It will degrade naturally after being discarded. At present, companies are already selling mycelium-based floor tiles, soundproof wall panels and insulation panels.

## Tool

1. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard)

![](https://www.idibu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/zapier-integration.png)

Zapier is an online platform that helps you `automate workflows by connecting your apps and services you use.`

To give an example, Zapier can automatically send out a custom tweet right after you've published a post. Or forward a slack message to your email address.

It does so by letting you create "Zaps", automated workflows that consist of a trigger and one or more actions. When you set up and activate a new Zap, it will run its action(s) every time the trigger event occurs.

2. [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)

![](https://github.com/nektos/act/wiki/quickstart/act-quickstart-2.gif)

Run your GitHub Actions locally!

When you run act, it reads in your GitHub Actions from .github/workflows/ and determines the set of actions that need to be run. It uses the Docker API to either pull or build the necessary images, as defined in your workflow files and finally determine the execution path based on the defined dependencies. Once it has the execution path, it then uses the Docker API to run containers for each action based on the earlier images. The environment variables and filesystem are all configured to match what GitHub provides.

## Videos

Neuralink, Elon Musk'sMusk's company, is developing a `fully-implanted, wireless, high-channel count brain-machine interface (BMI)` to enable people with paralysis to directly use their neural activity to operate computers and mobile devices with speed and ease.

Pager, a 9-year-old macaque monkey, had a Neuralink implanted about six weeks before the video was shot. He was first taught to play video games with a joystick for a banana smoothie reward, delivered through a metal straw. While he was doing this, `the Neuralink device recorded information about which neurons were firing — learning, essentially, to predict hand movements by recording which regions fired.`

After learning the patterns, the joystick Pager used to play was disconnected from the computer. The monkey appears to play the game using only his mind — playing a Pong game with no joystick whatsoever.

Elon Musk said the first product would enable some with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs.

Docker makes no configuration changes to your system … but it can use a significant volume of disk space.
Fortunately, Docker allows you to reclaim disk space from unused images, containers, and volumes.

2. Three Thoughts on Education​

David Perell shared three thoughts on education:

- Americans are obsessed with schooling but indifferent to learning when they should be obsessed with learning but indifferent to schooling.​
- If a student doesn’t know how to write, they probably don’t know how to think​
- Teachers complain that students don't listen to them but rarely ask if they're worth listening to in the first place.

## Comments

1.  I think a lot of people think they need OO, but they really just need modularity.
    --[Hacker News Reader](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26588045)

2.  If a person's knowledge is too specialized, he/she may find his/her specialty obsolete after a while. If one has a wide range of expertise, with the cooperation of lifelong education, his/her major can change with the change of times.
