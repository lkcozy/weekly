In this post, three authors transform the publicly available New Your Citi Bike trip data to analyze bike riding patterns.

They covered utilizing `DataBrew` to prepare data and `AWS Glue ETL` to process it in a regular operational ETL flow to gain insights from it.

They also demonstrated how to utilize `Athena` to perform SQL analysis on the dataset and visualize and create business intelligence reports using `QuickSight.`

## Comments

1.  My answer is generally 5-7 people for an experienced leader, but many factors affect the final number. Some of these factors include their leadership scope, other leadership roles, the experience level of the leader, the experience level of the team, and the level of organisational bureaucracy.

2.  Developers are the most valuable resource when creating software but their time is undervalued and misused.

3.  How am I meant to do 60 hours' development when I only have 40 hours?
    Working extra hours or weekends should only happen on go live situations. All the other deadlines on projects are artificial and only there because the plan has it.
    --Ditto
4.  There are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.
