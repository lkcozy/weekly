Project '44 helps historians, students, and families learn more about the wartime experiences of Allied troops in Europe using an interactive time-series map - now with 3D terrain for an even more immersive experience.

2. [what3words API](https://developer.what3words.com/public-api)

The what3words API is a fast and straightforward interface that converts 3-word addresses to coordinates and vice versa. In addition, it features a powerful AutoSuggest function, which can validate user input and limit it to certain geographic areas.

## AI/ML

1. [AI Sees Race in X-Rays](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-104/)

![](https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/race.gif)

Researchers from Emory University, MIT, Purdue University, and other institutions found that deep learning systems trained to interpret x-rays and CT scans also were able to identify their subjects as Asian, Black, or White.

**Why it matters**: The fact that diagnostic models recognize race in medical scans is startling. The mystery of how they do it only fuels worries that AI could magnify existing racial disparities in health care.

Neural networks can learn in ways that aren't intuitive to humans. Finding out how medical imaging algorithms learn to identify race could help develop less biased systems â€” and unlock other mysteries of machine learning.

## Tool

1. [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js)

```js
var parseString = require("xml2js").parseString;
var xml = "<root>Hello xml2js!</root>";
parseString(xml, function (err, result) {
  console.dir(result);
});

## Comments

1.  The main difference is the number of changes during the execution of the project. For example, if you're building an airplane, nobody will tell you that they want it to go to space in the middle of the project. But in the software industry, this is possible. This goes hand-in-hand with the logic of business that anything is possible in IT. If you built something that flies, then it should fly anywhere we want it to.
