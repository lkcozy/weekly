The real estate industry loves to use maps to help people with decisions about buying or selling property. `The challenge is that real estate data is detailed, dense, and current to inform decisions on a day to day basis.` There are an estimated 155 million property parcels and 166,000 neighbourhoods in the U.S. alone. Parcel data is packed with clear boundaries and property metadata such as ownership information, sales deeds or mortgages, and foreclosure activity. Neighbourhood data can contain numerous layers of ever-changing attributes such as crime rates, points of interest, school scores and districts, home prices, flood risk, and pricing trends.

TopHap is a real estate technology company that makes investor-grade analytics easy, intuitive, and accessible to everyone. TopHap equips Realtors with market trends and research-driven insights to advise home buyers with data-driven recommendations for the biggest purchase of their lives.

Earth2.io, the futuristic game for second earth, just launched new maps and heatmaps, all using MTS (Mapbox Tiling Service) at its core. The Earth 2 platform allows people to search, claim, purchase or bid on any piece of virtual land around the world. Users can name the land they purchase in anticipation of a future sale or hold it for future phases of Earth 2.

3. [Lacuna Space-The connectivity provider aims to bring LoRaWAN everywhere](https://lacuna.space)

Lacuna, which is an UK space startup, provides an `ultra-low cost tracking and sensor detection service for small amounts of data`.

The company has launched and operated 5 IoT gateway in space. Every satellite launch represents one more step in our mission to `provide LoRaWAN® connectivity to millions and millions of devices around the world` and see our service make a difference in so many applications: managing natural resources, improving food production or optimizing global infrastructure.

## AI/ML

1. [From Model-centric to Data-centric AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-84/)

![](https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-24-at-1.08.18-PM-copy.png)

Andrew Ng shared the skills he sees as fundamental to the next generation of machine learning practitioners.

`AI systems = Code + Data`

When a system isn't performing well, many teams instinctually try to improve the Code. But for many practical applications, it's more effective instead to focus on improving the Data.

It's a common joke that 80 percent of machine learning is data cleaning, as though that were a lesser task. My view is that if 80 percent of our work is data preparation, then ensuring data quality is the important work of a machine learning team.

2. [Partners in Surveillance](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-84/)

Police are increasingly able to track motor vehicles throughout the U.S. using a network of AI-powered cameras — many owned by civilians. Flock, which sells automatic license plate readers to homeowners associations, businesses, and law enforcement agencies, encourages enforcers to use its network to monitor cars and trucks outside their jurisdiction.

**Why it matters**: Commercial surveillance networks have been deployed without much oversight or consent, and police are rarely accountable for how they use such systems. Permissive policies around these devices amount to warrantless monitoring of millions of innocent people by police and fellow citizens.

**How it works**: Flock owners can opt to share data with police. In turn, police can share data with Flock's Total Analytics Law Officers Network, or Talon. Talon collects as many as 500 million vehicle scans each month. The network's cameras store video and send alerts when they spot vehicles flagged on watch lists. Users can search by model, colour, and features like spoilers or roof racks in addition to license plate numbers.

While A.I. can help police catch criminals, we do not condone a silent erosion of civil liberties and privacy. We support transparent, consistent guidelines on appropriate uses of face recognition, license plate readers, and other tracking technologies.

## Research

1. [Stealing Power](https://users.physics.unc.edu/~deardorf/phys25/rwp/exam1rwpsolution.html)

A physical exam question at a university in the USA. Is it possible to steal electricity by placing a large coil wire beneath the high-voltage transmission lines?

It's possible by using Faraday's Law of Induction, but this method is highly inefficient and impractical based on calculations.

## Comments

1.  Killer application is any computer program or software that is so necessary or desirable that it proves some larger technology's core value. In other words, consumers would benefit from the hardware just to run that application.

    --[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application)

2.  Total recorded music industry revenues were less than $20bn last year (half the peak in 2000)

3.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is an application of blockchain. The biggest feature is putting the website link into the blockchain. NFT artificially creates digital assets' ownership and scarcity to make the difference between copies.

4.  If we don't create the thing that kills Facebook, someone else will. Embracing changes isn't enough. It has to be so hardwired into who we are that even talking about it seems redundant. `The internet is not a friendly place. Things that don't stay relevant don't even get the luxury of leaving ruins. They disappear.`
