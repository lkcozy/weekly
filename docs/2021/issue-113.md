## GeoSpatial

GeoJSON is a way of representing geographic data. It consists of the following different parts:

- `Geometry` object: This is either the point, line, or polygon described earlier. The location information.
- `Feature` object: This is the geometry object and the associated random ad hoq data. Remember, GeoJSON doesn't care what data you associate with the location information.
- `FeatureCollection`: Just a list of feature objects.

2. [React Simple Maps](https://github.com/zcreativelabs/react-simple-maps)

React Simple Maps is a thin wrapper around d3-geo and topojson, providing a declarative API for making beautiful SVG maps in react with d3-geo and topojson using a declarative API.

2. [World Flood Mapping Tool](https://www.gislounge.com/world-flood-mapping-tool/)

One result of climate change is increased flooding risks, including flash floods that can devastate communities. Now flooding risk mapping has taken increased importance with the rise in risks from flooding. New tools attempt to mitigate these risks and help communities better prepare for future flooding.

3. [Mapping Natural Carbon Storage](https://www.gislounge.com/mapping-natural-carbon-storage/)

![](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_810+q_glossy+ret_img+to_webp/https://www.gislounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/map-irrecoverable-carbon-noon-et-al-2021-41893_2021_803.png)

Storage of existing carbon in Earth's natural biomes and sediments will be critical to achieving the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop26) goals of keeping rising global temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius.

One way to achieve this is to map locations of stored carbon and aim to keep that stored carbon in a state where it is not released into the atmosphere.

## AI/ML

1. [Deep Learning for Deep Frying](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-119-2/)

A robot cook is frying to order in fast-food restaurants.

**Why it matters**: Fast food's high-output, repetitive tasks are well suited to automation. The work can be hot, gruelling, and low-wage, leading to a turnover of employees that approaches 100 percent annually. Robots might pick up the slack â€” for better or worse.

**How it works**:

- The arm is equipped with thermal-imaging cameras and uses computer vision to locate and classify foods in the baskets.
- Miso can customize the system to recognize different foods and adjust cooking times and temperatures. For example, the company adjusted it to prepare chicken wings for Buffalo Wild Wings.
- Flippy 2 units are available to rent for around $3,000 a month in a business approach known as robots as a service.

## Tool

1. [Halfmoon](https://github.com/halfmoonui/halfmoon)

The front-end framework has a built-in dark mode and complete customizability using CSS variables; great for building dashboards and tools.

2. [Arco Design](https://github.com/arco-design/arco-design)

A comprehensive React UI components library based on the Arco Design system.

3. [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/)

An enterprise-class UI design language and React UI library.

4. [Juicebox](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface)

With Juicebox, projects are built and maintained by motivated punks getting paid transparently and funded by a community of users and patrons rewarded as the projects they support to succeed.

Users fund projects by paying to use an app or service or as a patron or investor by paying directly to your project's smart contract (like on this app).

5% of all money made by projects is sent to help pay for the maintenance and development of Juicebox itself. In exchange, projects get Juicebox tokens ($JBX)
Which will be worth more as the ecosystem grows over time.

5. [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/226529281/6f9ee94f2019c4f3af84bc60/image.png?expires=1618516800&signature=9eee1a89e5b2988992bc041f9c22af834908036a021b4530e1f40328efd17182)

Gnosis Safe is the most trusted platform to manage digital assets on Ethereum. It's a smart contract wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N).

1. [Options for optimizing caching in React](https://blog.logrocket.com/options-caching-react/)

The biggest challenge regarding React is avoiding unnecessary renders, which can cause significant performance issues, especially in larger applications. In this article, the author goes over a few different ways to optimize the performance of React applications through various methods for caching.

2. [Writing smart contracts with Solidity](https://blog.logrocket.com/writing-smart-contracts-solidity/)

Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum.

In this article, we looked at the basic building blocks of a Solidity contract and how to write, compile, deploy, and test our Solidity code using the Remix IDE.

## Comments

1. If an email is sent from me with explicit directions, there are only three actions allowed by managers.
   Email me back to explain why what I said was incorrect. Sometimes, I'm just plain wrong!
   Request further clarification if what I said was ambiguous.
   Execute the directions.
   If none of the above are done, that manager will be asked to resign immediately.
