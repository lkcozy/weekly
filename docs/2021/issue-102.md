This year's run of record-breaking wildfires, floods, and freezes is a preview of what to expect in a warmer world. In addition, startups are predicting how climate change will affect global commerce.

ClimateAI, based in San Francisco, built its model using long-range climatic simulations. As a result, the model provides short-term projections, helpful for detecting hazards for the following year, and long-term forecasts for crops in diverse areas.

Gro Intelligence, a New York-based firm founded in 2014, analyzes over 40,000 data sources, including satellite imagery and precipitation reports to forecast the severity of future droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events and their impacts on over 15,000 agricultural commodities.

One Concern analyzes data sources including Google Street View and satellite imagery to help customers plan for and execute disaster response plans,

## AI/ML

1. [Solar System](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-108/)

![](https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/09/SOLAR.gif)

Astronomers may use deep learning to keep the sun in focus.

**Why it matters**: Recalibrating the observatory using rocket data takes time since the equipment degrades between flights. Automated recalibration may keep the equipment running. This method may also benefit probes that monitor distant bodies and cannot use rocket-assisted correction.

**How it works**: The Solar Dynamics Observatory monitors activity in the sun's outer layers from space. Abrasion by light and particles from space dims its output. A costly and infrequent recalibration technique involves comparing the observatory's photos with similar images taken by instrumentation on tiny rockets. With the new model, the observatory may be adjusted continuously.

2. [Top 18 Low-Code and No-Code Machine Learning Platforms](https://serokell.io/blog/top-no-code-platforms)

![](https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/top-18-low-code-no-code-machine-learning-platforms.jpg)

The author introduced several no-code platforms for quick deployment of simple projects by non-tech experts or newbies in ML.

By no means can they substitute custom ML model development for high-load, data-intensive projects.

Low-code stands for a reduced amount of coding. No-code platforms require no knowledge of programming at all.

## Tool

1. [GitHub Web Editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/web-based-editor)

The web-based editor introduces a new, lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. With the web editor, you can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub and make and commit code changes. In addition, you can open any repository, fork, or pull request in the editor.

You can open any GitHub repository in the web-based editor in the following ways:

- Pressing the dot ( . ) key while browsing any repository on GitHub.
- Change the URL from "github.com" to "github.dev".

2. [Advanced Security Compliance](https://github.com/GeekMasher/advanced-security-compliance)

This Action was designed to allow users to configure their Risk threshold for security issues reported by [GitHub Code Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning), [Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-security/about-secret-scanning) and [Dependabot Security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/configuring-dependabot-security-updates#about-configuring-dependabot-security-updates).

3. [GitHub Action Dashboard](https://github.com/chriskinsman/github-action-dashboard)

![](https://github.com/ChrisKinsman/github-action-dashboard/raw/main/docs/images/ActionDashboardScreenShot.png)

A dashboard to keep track of the status of your GitHub Actions.

4. [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis)

Professionals supposedly come in three shapes.

- short: their skill set is broad but not deep
- fat: their skill set is deep but not broad.
- T-shaped: between the short and fat, knowing a lot about a little and a little about a lot

- Both dimensions can be helpful, but breadth gives us perspective and thus wisdom.
- On a long enough timeline, wisdom is always more valuable than knowledge.
- Depth helps you move fast, but breadth helps you move in the right direction.
- If you know exactly what you need, and you need it right now, choose depth.
  We often overvalue knowledge and undervalue wisdom because knowledge is relatively easy to test, but wisdom is hard.

## Comments

1. On a long enough timeline, wisdom is always more valuable than knowledge. We often overvalue ability and understanding because expertise is relatively easy to test, but learning is complex.

2. Job interviews are not all about your technical skills; it's about people skills too. And this is good because you need both in your job.
