The author believes that GIS has lost its way and becomes confusing software. He loves having all this functionality at hand from an expert perspective, but often, he wants a simple map application, do a couple of quick edits, and get out again.

`What is missing today is a simpler GIS that is stripped back with just a simple user interface and the basic tools.`

2. [How to protect the location privacy of connected workers](https://sensorup.com/webinars-privacy-connected-workers/)

The Webinar discusses how you can ensure your IoT data architecture is structured to handle privacy concerns.

- Review the privacy considerations for geolocation data in an industrial setting
- Learn the reference architecture of processing real-time location data streams
- Understand the three categories of privacy-preserving techniques for location data
- Learn how your technical teams can work with experts to design their IoT and AI applications to preserve data privacy

## AI

1. [Banking on Computer Vision](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-90/)

![](https://info.deeplearning.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/BANK576x324.gif?width=1200&upscale=true&name=BANK576x324.gif)

AI-powered surveillance is becoming a staple in U.S. banks. Several banks are using cameras equipped with computer vision to bolster security and boost employee productivity.

**Why it matters**: If banks can get regulators and consumers to accept AI-assisted surveillance in branch offices, it will add momentum to broader adoption of the technology.

Many of these use cases seem more like surveillance than security. Without sufficient sensitivity to public concerns, such efforts are likely to inspire backlash. Organizations that aim to take advantage of this technology: Tread cautiously.

5. [Deploy Node.js projects to AWS Lambda and API Gateway quickly](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia)

Claudia makes it easy to deploy Node.js projects to AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It automates all the error-prone deployment and configuration tasks and sets everything up the way. JavaScript developers expect out of the box. This means that you can quickly get started with Lambda and API Gateway and focus on solving critical business problems instead of dealing with AWS deployment workflows.

## Resources

1. [Avoid Focusing on Vanity Metrics in Software Testing](https://itnext.io/its-a-trap-avoid-focusing-on-vanity-metrics-in-software-testing-7a627c7848)

Don't focus on the test's vanity metrics. Look instead for `actionable metrics` (e.g., customer issues, recently changed code)—ones that indicate where you should focus your testing, where you can add value and quality to the product.

2. [99 Additional Bits of Unsolicited Advice from Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)

Kevin Kelly is the founding executive editor of Wired magazine. He shared 99 advices for everyone.

> Being wise means having more questions than answers.

The implication is that the so-called intelligent person does not know the answer but has more questions than others. So, according to this statement, those who are firm, unquestionable and tell you the solution are not so credible to KK.

> Money is overrated. Truly new things rarely need an abundance of money. If that was so, billionaires would have a monopoly on inventing new things, and they don't. Instead, almost all breakthroughs are made by those who lack money because they are forced to rely on their passion, persistence and ingenuity to figure out new ways. Being poor is an advantage in innovation.

The biggest problem for startups is that they don't have the resources, but KK thinks that's an advantage. A company can innovate not because it has money but more because it has no money and has to invent new methods.

> Recipe for success: under-promise and over-deliver.

> What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.

## Comments

1. The only metrics that entrepreneurs should invest energy in collecting are those that `help them make decisions.
   --[Vanity Metrics vs. Actionable Metrics](https://tim.blog/2009/05/19/vanity-metrics-vs-actionable-metrics/)

2. Find out where the issues are, the commonalities, and attempt to break down the biggest problems and what may be causing them. `If you can measure it, you can manage/improve it.

4. GIS has lost its way; it has become an awesome tool like the current mobile phones. It was amazing that you could roam wirelessly and make calls, but now you have a minicomputer everywhere you go. Some argue that it is no longer a phone, and so they named it a 'smartphone.' Maybe we are in the era of the 'smart GIS'
