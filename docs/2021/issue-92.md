# GISer's Weekly Issue 92

## GeoSpatial

1. [Automating GIS-processes 2019](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/index.html)

![](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/_images/AutoGIS_banner.jpg)

Automating GIS-processes -course teaches you how to do different GIS-related tasks in the Python programming language. Each lesson is a tutorial with a specific topic(s) where the aim is to learn how to solve common GIS-related problems and tasks using Python tools.

2. [Awesome Earth Engine](https://github.com/giswqs/Awesome-GEE)

A curated list of Google Earth Engine resources.

3. [Google Earth Engine Beginner's Cookbook](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/beginners-cookbook)

A tutorial introduces several types of geospatial data and enumerates essential Earth Engine functions for analyzing and visualizing them.

## AI/ML

1. [Flight Paths Optimized](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-98/)

An AI system is helping aircraft avoid bad weather, restricted airspace, and clogged runways.

**Why it matters**: Commercial air travel got battered by the pandemic. The industry’s recovery may depend on streamlining operations.

**How it works**: The system evaluates whether data, federal airspace closures, and the routes of all planned and active flights in the U.S. to find the most efficient paths for aircraft to reach their destinations.

**Results**: The system shaves off an average of 5.3 minutes from 63 percent of flights. That saved an estimated 480,000 gallons of fuel, reducing the airline’s carbon dioxide emissions by 4,600 tons.

2. [Emulate text style in images in one shot](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-can-now-emulate-text-style-in-images-in-one-shot-using-just-a-single-word/)

![](https://scontent.fyyc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/196363799_197223952277885_6519656961885957234_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=ad8a9d&_nc_ohc=vhGHXXFUfeIAX9desJ8&_nc_ht=scontent.fyyc2-1.fna&oh=f42a2eaf782e0a3a96cd3e9bb62568f6&oe=60F7A784)

Facebook introduces TextStyleBrush, an AI research project that can copy the style of text in a photo using just a single word. With this AI model, you can edit and replace text in images.

Unlike most AI systems that can do this for well-defined, specialized tasks, TextStyleBrush is the first self-supervised AI model that replaces text in images of both handwriting and scenes — in one shot — using a single example word.

3. [AI Pearls Counter](https://countthings.com/case-studies/0001)

![](https://countthings.com/Images/website/casestudies/cs_pearls6.jpg)

For many years, a Japanese pearl trade firm manually counted the number of pearls. They pour the pearls into a tiny plate with 100 pits, and if all of them are filled, there are 100 pearls. This was a time-consuming operation that required two people to count for two full days each harvest.

They now utilize the Android app CountThings From Photos. Take a photo of a pearl on a plate, and the phone will automatically compute how many pearls there are, saving you 30 minutes of effort.

## Research

1. [For soccer players, the less brain they use, the better for penalty kicks](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/may-15-california-condor-genetics-a-strange-star-goes-supernova-don-t-think-just-kick-and-more-1.6025290/for-soccer-players-the-less-brain-they-use-the-better-for-penalty-kicks-1.6025297)

![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6026688.1621002932!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/max-dualbriteclose-jpg.jpg)

New research suggests activation of cognitive areas of the brain is likely to compromise penalty kicking success in soccer. So don't think, kick.

Twenty-two volunteers were wearing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) headsets. This technology measures brain activity while a participant is on the move.

## Tool

1. [Zero Width Shortener (ZWS)](https://github.com/zws-im/zws)

![](https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202106/bg2021061202.jpg)

Shorten URLs using invisible spaces.

2. [dependency-version-badge](https://github.com/bahmutov/dependency-version-badge)

![prettier version](https://img.shields.io/badge/prettier-4.0.1-brightgreen)

A little script to update the README file with dependency version badge.

## Resources

1. [An incomplete list of skills senior engineers need, beyond coding](https://skamille.medium.com/an-incomplete-list-of-skills-senior-engineers-need-beyond-coding-8ed4a521b29f)

For varying levels of seniority, from senior to staff and beyond.

This article teaches you how to use the proxy function provided by the browser to bypass the access restriction of the SCI hub domain name.

## Comments

1. Technical writing is dying off. It’s all about clean, engaging UX now. Almost none of them have technical writers, and almost all of them have UX designers.

- It helps other people!
- Putting the writing on the internet really forces me to think about whether the lessons I think I learned actually make sense.
- When I’m writing, I often come up with additional questions and do a little bit of extra research, so I learn even more!
- Seeing other people’s reactions often helps me learn something new.
- If I want to remember what I learned about something in the past, I can just look it up on my blog!
