## Comments

1. We're trapped in a Never-Ending Now-blind to our place in history, engulfed in the present moment, overwhelmed by the slightest breeze of chaos.
   --[David Perell](https://perell.com/essay/never-ending-now/)

2. Grit, ambition and energy are more valuable than a specific skill set.

3. People like the virtual world as straightforward because the real world burden is too heavy, life is too tiring and boring. The virtual world is spiritual sustenance and a refuge, which lets you temporarily forget the real troubles and have a better and more exciting world to go.
   --[Yifeng Ruan](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2021/12/weekly-issue-187.html)

4. You only need to know the direction, not the destination. The direction is enough to make the next choice.
