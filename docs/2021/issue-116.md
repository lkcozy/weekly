The Databricks Lakehouse Platform simplifies data architectures by eliminating the data silos that traditionally separate analytics, data science and machine learning.

Now users can now seamlessly connect to Databricks and execute a powerful collection of spatial analysis functions, natively in the Data Lake Platform.

The extension supports the import of spatial data in many geo formats, lets users rapidly create insightful map-based visualizations and execute scalable spatial analysis functions natively, using push-down SQL queries.

## Comments

1. Most times, not everyone on a team agrees with the course of action. Even when you have enough cognitive diversity in the room, people still keep their mouths shut because people in power tend to reward people who agree with them while punishing those who dare to speak up with a dissenting view.
   --[An Approach to Making Better Decisions](https://fs.blog/kahneman-better-decisions/)

2. Microfame is the best kind of fame, because it combines an easier task (be famous to fewer people) with a better outcome (be famous to the right people).

3. The willingness to accept responsibility for one's own life is the source from which self-respect springs.
   --[Joan Didion]()

4. The greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. You need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.
   --[Adam Grant](https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers)

5. In the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions, but our inactions.
   --[Adam Grant](https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers)

6. The greatest danger for most of us doesn't lie in setting our aim too high and falling short, but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark.
   --[Michelangelo](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/michelangelo_108779)
