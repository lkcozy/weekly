1. [Wristband that turns body heat into electricity can power an LED](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2276215-wristband-that-turns-body-heat-into-electricity-can-power-an-led/)

A wearable wristband containing a thermoelectric generator (TEG) can convert body heat into electricity to power an LED. In future, the technology may be able to power smartwatches and end the need for traditional charging hardware.

The researchers hope to improve performance by increasing the size of the TEG on the Wristband and integrating a voltage converter to enable it to power larger electronics â€“ though they point out that doing so will require increasing the size of the whole device.

## Comments

1. Some come at life as a series of transactions. Some come at life as about building relationships. You can have a successful life doing transactions, but the only way to have a great life is on the relationship side.
   --[Jim Collins: Relationships vs. Transactions](https://fs.blog/knowledge-podcast/jim-collins-2/)

2. A powerful trick is writing something people intuitively know but haven't yet put into words. It works because readers learn something new without having to expend much energy questioning whether it's true.
