CARTO for React provides application templates to kickstart the app development process and a well-designed library that includes packages for user interface components, state management, or simplified connections with the CARTO platform through our APIs.

This product is based on some tremendous open-source libraries and frameworks like deck.gl (part of the vis.gl framework), React, Redux, and Material-UI.

In the following diagram, you can see the different functionality provided by the library.

The technology company Microsoft is one maker of augmented reality systems, and it was recently awarded a contract to make a particular version of these systems for the U.S. military. The HoloLens 2 AR headsets would be used to be trained for the extreme danger of fighting enemies within eyesight, person to person.

`Augmented reality, which takes virtual digital characters and overlays them onto scenes from the real world.`

The technology would help people train to be more aware of their environments, better engage their assets and make the decision necessary to overcome current and future issues.

There are some applications for AR headsets. One is their use in mixed reality when you interact with actual physical items in front of you and the virtual graphics you see through the glasses.

Critics say that increased use of these devices can make workers more dependent on technology and less on traditional know-how.

## AI/ML

1. [Tesla Safety Under Investigation](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-85/)

U.S. authorities are investigating Tesla's self-driving technology. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into 23 crashes of Tesla vehicles that occurred when the cars' autonomous driving systems may have been engaged.

**Why it matters**: The new investigations aim to find facts and not directly result in new rules for Tesla or the self-driving industry at large. While it may be true that Tesla's self-driving technology is safer on average than human drivers, it doesn't fit the description "full self-driving." `While Tesla's work to promote clean energy has had widespread positive impact, it's time for the company to drop that branding and for car makers to provide clear, consistent information about their autonomous capabilities.`

## Tool

## Videos

1. [One-take drone video of Minnesota bowling alley goes viral](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-12/hollywood-drone-video-minnesota-bowling-alley/13241718)

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7a99cc47d5de651a31353f9e8be8da8caf1ab7f6fe2be71934fd9bb694b5da27/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6265656b6b612e636f6d2f626c6f67696d672f61737365742f3230323130332f6267323032313033313330322e6a7067)

A single-take video shot with a drone flying through a Minnesota bowling alley has been hailed as "stupendous" by a string of celebrities and big-name filmmakers. It took about 10 to 12 attempts. The filmmakers were trying to encourage people to return to bars, restaurants and bowling alleys.

## Comments

1. What touched me about this story was not which path he chose, but how he dared to choose and did not compromise with the status quo. That kind of initiative and courage to grasp the fate of their own, I can not live like this, this is not the way I want, I must change life's direction, and then firmly put into action.

2. Most people lack the courage to let life push them forward and go with the flow. A young person who graduated from high school didn't know much about oneself or society. Parents decide their university majors. When they find they're not interested in their majors, they don't know what to do. They often choose to get a diploma first and then muddle alone. They don't have the courage to be responsible for fate and the motivation to cut off all means of retreat.
   --Ditto

3. Travel is a great experience to have, but I would not put much hope in being truly transformative. Now, almost 10 years later, it just like it never happen, memories are fading fast as I went with settled life.
