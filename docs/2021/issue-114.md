## GeoSpatial

1. [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io)

[pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io) is a Python server implementation of the [OGC API](https://ogcapi.ogc.org) suite of standards. The project emerged as part of the next-generation OGC API efforts in 2018. It provided the capability for organizations to deploy a RESTful OGC API endpoint using OpenAPI, GeoJSON, and HTML.

2. [How IoT and Ultra-Wideband Go Hand in Hand](https://www.iotforall.com/how-iot-and-ultra-wideband-go-hand-in-hand)

Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a radio-based communication technology for short-range use and fast and stable data transmission.

UWB enables devices to communicate with each other without the need for line of sight, which means IoT can finally become a reality in places other than our homes and offices.

## AI/ML

Computer vision systems are surveying sewers for signs of decay and degradation.
**Why it matters**: Failed pipes can cause flooding, spread disease, and pollute water sources. By helping human inspectors prioritize repairs, computer vision could help stretch those dollars across more miles of pipe.

**How it works**: SewerAI's computer vision system classifies defects like cracks, holes, displacements, tree roots, and incursions in videos taken by sewer-crawling robots and human inspectors.

2. [A Deeper Look at Graphs](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-120/)

Neural networks designed to process datasets in the form of a graph — a collection of nodes connected by edges — have delivered nearly state-of-the-art results with only a handful of layers.

**Why it matters**: Not all types of data can be represented easily as an image or text - consider a social network - but almost all can be described as a graph. `This suggests that deep GNNs could prove helpful in solving a wide variety of problems.

**How it works**:

**The Results**:

## Research

1. [Chinese researchers make DNA storage breakthroughs](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202112/02/WS61a86d16a310cdd39bc78f4f.html)

![](https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202112/02/61a870fea310cdd3d81e4929.jpeg)

Chinese researchers have recently made technical breakthroughs in DNA storage, achieving the integration of DNA synthesis and sequencing and miniaturization of instruments.

## Tool

1. [Repobeats](https://repobeats.axiom.co/)

![](https://repobeats.axiom.co/_next/image?url=%2Freadme.png&w=384&q=75)

Repobeats is a way to embed contributor analytics into your GitHub project's README.md.

With Repobeats, contributors and users of your projects get a clear, beautiful view of how your project is evolving.

2. [Microdiff](https://github.com/AsyncBanana/microdiff?ck_subscriber_id=1238258824)

Microdiff is a tiny (currently <1kb), fast, zero dependency object and array comparison library. It is significantly faster than most other deep comparison libraries and has full TypeScript support.

3. [OCRmyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

![](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/logo.svg)

OCRmyPDF adds an optical character recognition (OCR) text layer to scanned PDF files, allowing them to be searched.

## Videos

1. [The PERFECT 10 Minute Daily Posture Routine (FIX YOUR SIT!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqcOCBb4arc)

![](https://builtwithscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bad-posture-excessive-sitting-1024x576.jpg)

To reverse the adverse effects of sitting too much, this video will be showing you two quick and easy 5-minute corrective routines with eight exercises for posture that you can do anywhere, that are designed to mobilize these tightened areas (fix rounded shoulders), strengthen the weakened muscles (improve hunchback posture), and work on correcting any asymmetries. Let's get straight to covering the exercises for better posture.

## Resources

1. [Local Storage vs Cookies (for auth tokens)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/cubcpj/local_storage_vs_cookies_for_auth_tokens/)

Local Storage is better than cookies.

Local Storage is only vulnerable to XSS. Cookies are vulnerable to XSS and CSRF.

If somebody can inject code into your website, no cookies nor local storage will help you or mitigate anything at all.

2. [React folder structure for enterprise-level applications](https://medium.com/@kolbysisk/react-folder-structure-for-enterprise-level-applications-f8384eff162b)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/301/1*6Cb3CowNkf7tgCE12tqJzw.png)

This article aims to explain the reasoning behind this structure so that you can use these ideas to architect the best solution for your project.

- Composability allows you to reuse code between components.
- Local first.
- Flatter is better.
- Nest as you grow.
- Stop using PascalCase for file names. Instead, use kebab-case for all files.
- Use a server-state tool like React Query or Redux Toolkit Query.
- Use a component library like MUI.
- Use a hook library like use hooks-ts for common hooks.

The path isn't a straight line; It's a spiral. You continually come back to things you thought you understood and see deeper truths.

## Comments

1. More people determine the fates of others without having to pay the consequences. Skin in the game means you own your own risk. It means people who make decisions in any walk of life should never be insulated from the consequences of those decisions, period. If you're a helicopter repairman, you should be a helicopter rider.

2. What I've learned in business and in life is you've got to be a competitive compromiser. And that requires kindness, empathy, ingenuity but the same level of aggressive, competitive spirit.

3. Knowledge sticks in our memories easier if it attaches to something we understand.
   --[Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/remember-books/)

4. "Man, every minute this thing gets done sooner, we can start generating cash." We do not have that mentality in the West.

5. Serial-position effect is the tendency of a person to recall the first and last items in a series best, and the middle items worst.
