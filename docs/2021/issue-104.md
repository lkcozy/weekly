# GISer's Weekly Issue 105, 2021-09-24

## GeoSpatial

1. [Using GIS to Identify Food Deserts](https://www.gislounge.com/using-local-knowledge-to-better-map-food-deserts/)

In a recent study, many geospatial researchers used food stores as permanent sites rather than complicated nodes in a distribution network with intricate relationships with shoppers. Thus, to comprehend food deserts, one must consider store preferences, merchant relationships with locals, and shopper movement patterns.

2. [A Look Back at 18 Months of COVID Grants & Maps](https://carto.com/blog/look-back-18-months-covid-grants-maps/)

At first, many maps and visualizations focused on the virus's transmission, where cases grew the quickest both locally and nationally. Initially, these maps helped raise awareness at a period when most of the globe was under lockdown. However, thanks to the scientific community's historical reaction, many now monitor vaccine progress.

3. [OGC API – Environmental Data Retrieval specification](https://www.ogc.org/pressroom/pressreleases/4559)

OGC API: EDR makes it easy for users to access subsets of spatial 'big data' through a uniform, well-defined, simple web interface that hides the complexities of data storage.

OGC APIs are modern, modular, flexible, simple-yet-powerful "building blocks for location" that make it easy for anyone to publish or consume geospatial data on the FAIR web: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

## AI/ML

1. [Driverless Delivery in High Gear](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-110/)

![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/WALMART.gif?upscale=true&width=1200&upscale=true&name=WALMART.gif)

Walmart aims to deliver goods via self-driving vehicles this year.

**Why it matters**: Although self-driving vehicles aren't ready for widespread use, the partnership between one of the world's largest retailers and one of its biggest automakers signals the potential for near-term commercial applications.

Fully self-driving cars will likely reach the market through a vertical niche that is more accessible than building vehicles that can handle all circumstances.

2. [PaddleSeg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg)

PaddleSeg is an end-to-end image segmentation development kit developed based on PaddlePaddle, covering many high-quality segmentation models in different directions, such as high-performance and lightweight.

3. [Machine Learning from Scratch](https://github.com/dafriedman97/mlbook)

![](https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/_images/logo_light.png)

This book covers the building blocks of the most common methods in machine learning. This set of plans is like a toolbox for machine learning engineers.

## Tool

1. [Node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config)

Node.js Application Configuration.

2. [Image to LaTeX](https://github.com/kingyiusuen/image-to-latex)

![](https://github.com/kingyiusuen/image-to-latex/raw/main/figures/screenshot.gif)

Convert images of LaTex math equations into LaTex code.

3. [absurd-sql](https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql)

absurd-sql is a filesystem backend for sql.js that allows SQLite to read/write from IndexedDB in small blocks, just like a disk.

absurd-sql intercepts read/write requests from SQLite and fetching and persisting them into IndexedDB

## Resources

1. [Automating a software company with GitHub Actions](https://posthog.com/blog/automating-a-software-company-with-github-actions)

This post shows how a good CI solution can automate your engineering workflow and help you focus on actual challenges instead of chores.

2. [Teaching by filling in knowledge gaps](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/20/teaching-by-filling-in-knowledge-gaps/)

The author describes his steps for explaining something:

- Notice a useful idea that I think is on the edge of a lot of people's knowledge
- Make a bunch of assumptions about what I think that group of people generally know (usually based on what I know and what I think my friends/coworkers know)
- Explain the idea using those assumptions
- use people's existing knowledge when teaching
- explain just one concept at a time
- use bugs to peel back abstractions

3. [Blockchain Consensus Encyclopedia](https://tokens-economy.gitbook.io/consensus/)

![](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LLG7gr0ydPNrSJQ43vf%2F-L_iZxa6g34SxFiavXti%2F-L_i_KAsL6qzKH4BNQe5%2FBlockchainConsensusEncyclopedia-by-tokens-economy.com.png?alt=media&token=f84fbfe7-4a94-43b3-b0b9-168bf951c78f)

More than 84 Blockchain Consensus were described.

## Comments

1. Decentralization is more difficult than centralization, and because decentralized options often remove the commercial incentive available to centralized options, no one's really pushing it. There’s not enough money available for someone to spend the time and energy needed to build truly great options, that remain true to the decentralized nature.
