Monitoring building activity is critical for businesses and public organizations since it saves time and money.

ConsTRACK, a new platform, allows users to examine Earth Observation (EO) satellite data in a way that highlights updates and changes to locations as projects develop.

## Research

1. [Scientists say a telescope on the Moon could advance physics — and they're planning to build one](https://www.salon.com/2021/09/05/scientists-say-a-telescope-on-the-moon-could-advance-physics-and-theyre-hoping-to-build-one/)

The Moon provides significantly more than most people know. The natural satellite that brightens up the night sky moderates Earth's tilt, making our climate more stable and tolerable. The Earth's axial tilt would be unstable without the Moon, causing unpredictable seasons and perhaps killing out life. The Moon also causes tides, which assist transport heat from the equator to the poles through the ocean.

## Resources

1. [How to develop, test, and deploy smart contracts using Ganache](https://blog.logrocket.com/develop-test-deploy-smart-contracts-ganache/)

![](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ganache-dashboard.jpeg)

Web3 is flourishing, and it's a new frontier. Most decentralized applications (Dapps) employ smart contracts as their backend. Thus understanding how to create, test, and deploy them will be necessary. This tutorial will show you how to get started with smart contracts.

2. [How I made $50K in 3 days with NFTs](https://paulstamatiou.com/how-i-made-50k-in-3-days-with-nfts/)

The author talked about his understanding of NFT and how to get started, then he used software to generate a set of digital paintings (above) that sold for $50,000 in NFT form.

3. [Understanding The Basics Of Electricity By Thinking Of It As Water](https://www.freeingenergy.com/understanding-the-basics-of-electricity-by-thinking-of-it-as-water/)

![](https://www.freeingenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Electricity-101-v2-1024x576.png)

The three most essential components of electricity are voltage, current, and resistance.

- VOLTAGE is like the pressure that pushes water through the hose. It is measured in volts (V).
- CURRENT is like the diameter of the hose. The wider it is, the more water will flow through. It is measured in amps (I or A).
- RESISTANCE is like sand in the hose that slows down the water flow. It is measured in ohms (R or Ω).
