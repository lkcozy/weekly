Since the outbreak of the pandemic, many things have changed in our daily lives. The commercial real estate sector is undergoing rapid structural changes due to various lockdown measures and the rise of working from home (WFH). According to Gartner, 74% of companies want to provide remote work to their workers.

The author demonstrated how spatial analysis (e.g., ) could help involved stakeholders make better decisions.

For example,

- indoor analytics lets us collect and analyze data to manage human capacity and understand how surrounding residential use shopping malls in the new normal.
- green space usage analysis is used to understand green space usage and its impact on the people living nearby.

- `neighborhood analysis` is helpful in determining which of these homes may be more appealing to those people temporarily relocating for WFH tourism.

## AI/ML

1. [Face Recognition for the Masses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-93/)

![](https://info.deeplearning.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20-%202021-05-25T094231.843.gif?width=1200&upscale=true&name=ezgif.com-gif-maker%20-%202021-05-25T094231.843.gif)

PimEyes is an online face recognition service that allows users to search the internet for images of themselves. Its goal is to assist individuals in managing their online identities and prevent identity theft. But privacy activists are concerned that the tool may be used to track or harass people.

**Why it matters**: The broad ability to find online matches for any face erodes personal privacy. It also fuels efforts to regulate face recognition, which might lead to limits that prevent productive uses of the technology.

**How it works**: PimEyes has gathered geometric data from more than 900 million online faces. The tool analyses the geometry of user's faces to those in its databases and returns any matches.

Scientists developed a shape morphing technique that can flat-pack many materials, including edible materials like Italian pasta, and morph when cooked. This is inspired by how furniture is flat packed to save packaging space during transportation.

1. [How to Be a Successful Entrepreneur â€“ A Developer's Guide to Startup Strategy and Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/be-a-successful-entrepreneur-developers-guide-to-startup-strategy-and-design/)

A developer's guide to startup strategy and design. The author recommends starting putting the methods into practice rather than reading the entire guide and attempting to internalize it. The ultimate skill entrepreneurs need to have is figuring things out under extreme uncertainty.

- Strategy and design can help minimize chances of failing in a startup by focusing on customer needs, competitive advantages, and constant iteration.
- Components of a business strategy include defining purpose, developing hypotheses, testing hypotheses, and designing the product.
- Strategy involves breaking down markets, value propositions, and differentiation into individual parts, like a scientific mindset.

## Comments

1. People who write a lot also listen a lot. They also change their mind a lot. Not necessarily with new data, but sometimes re-analyzing the same data. They also work hard to disconfirm fundamental biases.
   --[Jeff Bezos]

2. The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.
   --[Sherlock Holmes](https://openlettersreview.com/posts/its-a-mystery-the-world-is-full-of-obvious-things-which-nobody-by-any-chance-ever-observes)

3. If you wish you would take something more seriously, do it publicly. Social pressure forces you to up your game.
   --[James Clear-the author of Atomic Habits](https://perell.com/essay/why-you-should-write/)

4. Re-writing is re-thinking. Writing is the best way to sharpen your ideas. The only thing standing between you and your writing goals is discipline.
