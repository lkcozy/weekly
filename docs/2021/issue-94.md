Rockley Photonics, a silicon photonics technology company, has launched its complete full-stack, “clinic-on-the-wrist” digital health sensor system.

The sensor module and associated reference designs for consumer products integrate hardware and application firmware to enable wearable devices to monitor multiple biomarkers, including core body temperature, blood pressure, body hydration, alcohol level, lactate, and glucose trends, among other variables.

## AI/ML

1. [Walking the Dog](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-100/)

![](https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/ezgif.com-gif-maker---2021-07-14T100209.763.gif)

Researchers at UC Berkeley, Facebook, and Carnegie Mellon developed Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA). The system enabled a Unitree Robotics A1 to negotiate changing conditions and unexpected obstacles nearly in real-time.

**Why it matters**: RMA is among the first robotic walking systems that don’t need to be trained for every variety of terrain they're likely to encounter.

**How it works**: The system includes two algorithms, both of which are trained in simulation. The reinforcement learning component learns to control locomotion basics, while the adaptation module learns to generate a representation of the environment.

## Tool

1. [React 360](https://github.com/facebookarchive/react-360)

React 360 is a framework for the creation of interactive 360 experiences that run in your web browser.
