## Comments

1.  The purpose of academic writing is to communicate. Your writing is a window into your thoughts, with a written thesis letting the thought show through.
    --[University of Sunderland]()

2.  Try not to be confined to a single language or tool; pick whatever is best suited to solve your problem fast and effectively.
    --[What tools to use for your next web-based project?](https://betterengineeringclub.substack.com/p/what-tools-to-use-for-your-next-web)

3.  A complex system that works is invariably evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears true: a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a simple system.
    --[John Gall, systems theorist](https://www.ivanmontilla.com/blog/galls-law-and-how-i-ignored-it)
