OmniSciDB is an open-source SQL-based, relational, columnar database engine that leverages modern hardware's entire performance and parallelism (both CPUs and GPUs) to enable querying of multi-billion row datasets in milliseconds, without the need for indexing, pre-aggregation, or downsampling.

## AI/ML

1. [Listening to the Brain](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-101/)

Neural networks translated a paralyzed man’s brainwaves into conversational phrases. So what’s new: Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley trained a system to interpret electrical impulses from the Brain of a man who had lost the ability to speak 15 years ago and displayed them as words on a video screen.

**Why it matters**: Accidents, diseases, and other tragedies rob countless people of their ability to communicate. This technology opens a pathway for them to reconnect.

**How it works**: The researchers implanted an array of 128 electrodes into the region of the Brain responsible for the movement of the mouth, lips, jaw, tongue, and larynx. They connected the implant to a computer. Then they asked the patient to try to speak 50 common words and 50 common phrases and recorded the resulting brain activity. They trained the system on 22 hours of these signals,

**Results**: During tests, the system decoded a median of 15.2 words per minute and translated sentences with a median error rate of 25.6 percent.

It’s wonderful to see natural language models restoring the most natural form of language.

## Comments

1.  Peoples’ belief in their approach to getting things done can result in them ignoring higher-performing alternatives; this behaviour has become known as the illusion of control.
    --[Evidence-based Software Engineering](https://www.reactguide.dev/)

2.  As you coach someone through a challenge or dilemma, replace problem-solving,advice-giving, and judgy-sounding questions with authentically curious, truly open questions.

3.  Coding is not a survival skill. Compare it with speaking, reasoning, common sense, finding food, and realize you cannot put it in the same bucket.

4.  At Amazon, Most of the time, there isn't a meeting if there isn’t a doc. Meetings start with reading. Then attendees could discuss it.
