For geographers and scientists, mapping ocean currents and understanding their change is vital, particularly as our planet changes and is under threat from a variety of environmental changes, particularly climate change.

2. [Open-Source Science in the Cloud Collaboration](https://www.gislounge.com/platform-for-analyzing-geospatial-data-in-the-cloud/)

Recently, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) released a new open source and science tool called the Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP). Combining NASA and ESA, these two agencies lead the world in providing satellite and remote sensing data for understanding the Earth’s environment.

With MAAP, the data are now combined and offer users a large body of data that can now better understand how our planet is changing through a common user interface. The tool is currently limited in covering Earth Science topics using data from NASA and ESA, but this will greatly expand over the next year.

## AI/ML

Clone a voice in 5 seconds to generate arbitrary speech in real-time.

2. [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter)

Spleeter is Deezer source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses Tensorflow.

3. [Machine Learning for Beginners - A Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners)

A 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum all about Machine Learning. In this curriculum, you will learn about what is sometimes called classic machine learning, using primarily Scikit-learn as a library and avoiding deep learning.

## Research

1. [What is the F-score?](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/f-score)

![](https://images.deepai.org/user-content/9954225913-thumb-4901.svg)

The F-score is a measure of model's accuracy on a dataset. It's a way of combining the precision and recall of the model. The F-score is commonly used for evaluating machine learning models and search engines.

> precision: the number of true positives divided by the number of false positives plus true positives.
> recall: the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false negatives.

## Tool

1. [WantWords](https://github.com/thunlp/WantWords)

An open-source online reverse dictionary.

> Reverse Dictionary: Opposite to a regular (forward) dictionary that provides definitions for query words, a reverse dictionary returns words semantically matching the query descriptions.

2. [Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow)

The free IFTTT/Zapier alternative for developers to automate their workflows based on Github actions

## Videos

1. [Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg PhD [Mind Map Book Summary]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pje2TsLrsQ)

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pje2TsLrsQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

BJ Fogg nows habits. He's been a researcher and founder of the Stanford Behavior Design Lab. A whole lab dedicated to designing behaviours. His book Tiny Habits walks us step by step through everything they have learned about changing behaviour. The book shows us how to create new habits and break old ones. The biggest takeaway from this book is that habits need prompts and the the best prompts are anchors.

## Resources

2. [Why IndexedDB is slow and what to use instead](https://rxdb.info/slow-indexeddb.html)

The author analyzes why using IndexedDB is slow and how to use is correctly. The result shows that we need to using IndexedDB as a filesystem, not as a database.

## Comments

1.  The situations of Asian countries and the United States differ substantially in the details, but both face the same core problem: how to offer many people as possible a decent job with a family wage.

2.  Any kind of important book should immediately be read twice, partly because one grasps the matter in its entirely the second time, and only really understands the beginning when the end is known; and partly because in reading it the second time one's temper and mood are different, so that one gets another impression; it may be that one see the matter in another light.
