## GeoSpatial

1. [I3S: Enabling 3D GIS Everywhere](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/presentations/Geospatial_ESRI_SIGGRAPH_Aug21.pdf)

[I3S(Indexed 3D Scene Layer)](https://github.com/Esri/i3s-spec) is an OGC Community Standard. I3S enables the storage and streaming of massive amounts of heterogeneously distributed geospatial content, in the form of millions of discrete 3D objects with attributes, integrated surface meshes and point cloud data covering vast geographic areas, to web browsers, mobile apps and desktop.

A look at what it takes to incorporate 3D models of buildings, terrain, and environment into Geospatial applications. Specific examples include Cesium, Unreal Engine (4 and 5), and others from the Geospatial community. In addition, the presenters will examine particular problems raised by attendees.
