The author introduces how to visualize the global spread of COVID-19 using Google BigQuerie's GeoViz tool. Google provides a free COVID-19 dataset for the public.

Unfolded Studio is an online geospatial data analysis platform built based on a variety of open geospatial stack, such as the deck.gl, kepler.gl, H3, etc. It's designed to visualize large amounts of location data and perform different geospatial analytics against the location data. You can also customize the map applications by using the Unfolded Map SDK directly, which is based on deck.gl.

3. [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/)

The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification provides a common language to describe a range of geospatial information to be indexed and discovered more easily. A "spatiotemporal asset" is any file representing `information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.`

## AI

1. [The Fax About Tracking Covid](https://blog.deeplearning.ai/blog/the-batch-propagandists-lie-about-ai-language-models-grok-images-machines-triage-covid-cases-world-models-shrink)

California's Contra Costa County's public health department is using deep learning to sort Covid-19 cases reported via the pre-internet technology known as fax.

**Why it matters**: According to a 2019 survey, 89 percent of U.S. health organizations still rely on fax to transmit medical information. Anything that accelerates the processing of that information is a plus â€” especially during a pandemic.

**How it works**: Hospitals and medical labs document cases of coronavirus infection using hand-written forms. Many transmit the documents to public health officials over telephone landlines. Stanford University researchers developed Covid Fast Fax to evaluate them so that public health workers, who still manually review each case, can spot the most critical ones. The system comprises two convolutional neural networks.

- One model culls Covid-19 reports from other incoming faxes.
- The second model determines which reports are most urgent. It ranks each case's severity by reading checkboxes that indicate a patient's symptoms, gender, isolation status, and other details.

It's 2021, and hospitals are still relying on fax to make critical decisions? AI can help hospitals cope with outmoded communications technology, but it's no substitute for updating U.S. health care infrastructure.

1. [Managers should code, but not at work](https://nngorok.com/managers-should-code-but-not-at-work)

The main reasons being, attempting to code on your team will `make you a blocker to others on the team,` there aren't enough hours in the day to have all your meetings and one on ones as well as code, and it is essential to demonstrate trust to your team by stepping back from coding.

On the flip side, as time passes and you aren't coding as a manager, you get `disconnected` from your team. You slowly begin to forget what it is like to build systems and products. You find it `harder to follow` some of the team's technical decisions. In the long run, this can lead, in the worst case, to a loss of respect from the team due to a `lack of credibility.`

In the end, I'm going to continue to code, but not at work. I need a clear delineation between being a manager and coding to focus on my team and meetings.

## Comments

1. Himalaya had created such an immense river network that it left behind staggeringly rich soil across a vast swath of Asia. On either side of these mountains lie the world's two most populous nations, India and China. If you include Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, all of which also greatly depend on rivers sourced in the Himalaya, we're talking about nearly half of humankind tied to these mountains.
