## GeoSpatial

1. [Sensor Web Enablement DWG](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/sensorwebdwg)

This domain working group works to find best practices to better connect Space/Sky/Surface Sensor data interoperability.

- Observations & Measurements (O&M) - Standard models and XML Schema for encoding observations and measurements from a sensor, both archived and real-time.
- Sensor Model Language (SensorML) - Standard models and XML Schema for describing sensors systems and processes associated with sensor observations; provides information needed for discovery of sensors, location of sensor observations, processing of low-level sensor observations, and listing of taskable properties, as well as supports on-demand processing of sensor observations.
- Sensor Observations Service (SOS) - Standard web service interface for requesting, filtering, and retrieving observations and sensor system information. This is the intermediary between a client and an observation repository or near real-time sensor channel.
- Sensor Planning Service (SPS) - Standard web service interface for requesting user-driven acquisitions and observations. This is the intermediary between a client and a sensor collection management environment.
- SensorThings API (STA) - a RESTful web service based on JSON encoding that provides an open and unified way to interconnect Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data, and applications over the Web. This is the intermediary between a client (e.g., web application) and an observation repository or near real-time IoT sensor/actuator.

2. [IoT for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/IoT-For-Beginners)

![](https://github.com/microsoft/IoT-For-Beginners/raw/main/sketchnotes/Roadmap.jpg)

A 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum all about IoT basics provided by Microsoft.

The projects cover the journey of food from farm to table. This includes farming, logistics, manufacturing, retail and consumer - all popular industry areas for IoT devices.

3. [Cos4Cloud](https://cos4cloud-eosc.eu/)

![](https://cos4cloud-eosc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/infografia-mve-cos4cloud.png)

Cos4Cloud is a European Horizon 2020 project to boost citizen science technologies

Cos4Cloud will create a minimum viable ecosystem where the citizen observatories, technological services, citizen science experts validating data and users are able to establish synergies and collaborate to generate high-quality data in global repositories.

To enable greater compatibility when creating Citizen Science data using the SensorThings API, an extension to the SensorThings Data Model was created, built, and delivered.

## AI/ML

1. [Wake Up and Smell the AI](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-106/)

Coffee producers are using machine learning to grow better beans.

**Why it matters**: Previously it relied on human experts to assess whether these grafts were viable. This may be bad for traditional plant assessors, whose skills may become obsolete. On the other hand, it may help struggling Colombian coffee farmers grow more profitable beans.

**How it works**: The algorithm uses readings from a handheld near-infrared optical scanner to automate the evaluation. The scanner measures light frequencies reflected by the plants, which the algorithm interprets as markers of plant health.

2. [Alien Dreams: An Emerging Art Scene](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/posts/clip-art/)

Ever since OpenAI released the weights and code for their CLIP model, various hackers, artists, researchers, and deep learning enthusiasts have figured out how to utilize CLIP as a an effective “natural language steering wheel” for various generative models, allowing artists to create all sorts of interesting visual art merely by inputting some text – a caption, a poem, a lyric, a word – to one of these models.

## Tool

1. [Apache Superset ](https://github.com/apache/superset)

![](https://github.com/apache/superset/raw/master/superset-frontend/images/screenshots/gallery.jpg)

Apache Superset is a Data Visualization and Data Exploration Platform。 It visualize geospatial data with deck.gl

2. [SonarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/)

![](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-vscode/raw/HEAD/images/sonarlint-vscode.gif)

SonarLint is a Free and Open Source IDE extension that identifies and helps you fix quality and security issues as you code.

3. [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport)

Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.

The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.

## Resources

1. [OpenMetadata](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*dBAlmsGVfLNe6qK8gH2rvA.png)

OpenMetadata is an Open Standard for Metadata. A Single place to Discover, Collaborate, and Get your data right.

Poorly organized data prevents organizations from realising its full potential. Metadata is incorrect, inconsistent, outdated, and missing, hiding a full picture of data.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Q5sZOhDuhnxbbnLFvLendg.png)

Data consistency throughout the company requires a Single Source of Truth (SoT) for metadata. Keeping a single source is significantly easier than maintaining numerous copies of metadata scattered across many platforms.

2. [Demystifying Public Speaking](https://demystifying-public-speaking.com/index.html#table-of-contents)

Lara Hogan helps you discover and overcome your fear so you can take the stage (big or small).

From picking a subject and crafting a presentation to gathering and synthesizing feedback to event day planning, get clear, practical guidance. You'll be ready to take the stage with confidence.

## Comments

1.  Using a certain technology doesn’t make you superior to anyone else.
    --[Sha Alibhai](https://twitter.com/hashtagcoder/status/1327660760001110016)

2.  There's a lot of different interpretations about what makes someone a senior. For some it's all about experience, for others it's about career length. For me personally, `it's about elevating yourself to think outside of your own contributions`.

3.  Frequency illusion is a cognitive bias in which, after noticing something for the first time, there is a tendency to notice it more often, leading someone to believe that it has a high frequency.

4.  What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months.
    --[Less turned out to be more](https://www.hashtagcoder.dev/blog/reflecting-on-my-team-building-strategy)

5.  A computer program is simply a description of an idea, and the ability to write complex code does not a great programmer make. The best programmers are able to come up with simple solutions to complex problems. The worst programmers are those who devise complex solutions to simple problems.
