Wildfires are burning longer and more frequently in some northern latitudes due to climate change. Wildfires are often triggered by lightning, intentional land clearing, or human-caused accidents. Higher than normal temperatures and drier than normal conditions are further exacerbating conditions.

The recent heatwave that settles over much of the Pacific Northwest and Canada also created conditions that triggered multiple wildfires in Canada.

2. [Wireless Smart Agriculture Kit–Greenhouses](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wireless-Smart-Agriculture-Kit-Greenhouses-p-4952.html)

SenseCAP Wireless Smart Agriculture Kit – Greenhouse monitors the environmental parameters in greenhouses for Precision Agriculture using LoRaWAN technology. This kit can precisely monitor microclimates and soil conditions inside each greenhouse, thus providing data-driven insights to create a perfect environment for the plants to maximize yields with energy-efficient methods.

LoRaWAN’s wireless feature helps get rid of the fuss of setting up cables. In addition, the ultra-long distance communication makes it cost-effective, with only one gateway connecting to 200 sensor nodes in the communication range.

3. [Scatter Plots on Maps using Plotly](https://towardsdatascience.com/scatter-plots-on-maps-using-plotly-79f16aee17d0)

Learn how to create interactive scatter maps to represent multiple features in your data with very little code.

Plotly is a powerful visualization library that provides amazing capabilities like interactive, dynamic, easy to use, and highly detailed plots.

In this article, you will be using the San Francisco Airbnb listings dataset from Kaggle to visually analyze the relation between prices, types of accommodations, and their areas. Then, by simply looking at the map, we shall see how the area affects the price.

## AI/ML

1. [Meet the New Smart-Cities Champ](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-102/)

![](https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/CITY--1-.gif)

For the first time, Chinese researchers swept a competition to develop AI systems that monitor urban traffic.

**Why it matters**: This competition is the latest example of China’s rising profile in AI. The Chinese government has funded hundreds of Smart City programs.

Smart-city technology could make urban living more pleasant and productive, yet it also carries a risk of invasive surveillance. We call on regulators and researchers who work on such projects worldwide to lead a global debate on appropriate privacy standards and design their systems that protect privacy from the ground up.

State-of-the-art 2D and 3D Face Analysis Project.

## Research

1. [An Effective Self-Powered Piezoelectric Sensor for Monitoring Basketball Skills](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/15/5144)

![](https://www.mdpi.com/sensors/sensors-21-05144/article_deploy/html/images/sensors-21-05144-g001-550.jpg)

Self-powered piezoelectric sensors can monitor motion processes in real-time and without external power sources. They can be mounted to the skin or joints of the body to detect human motion and are driven by mechanical energy rather than electricity.

Therefore, `the emerging application of flexible sensors have huge long-term prospects in sport big data collection and Internet of Things (IoT).`

## Tool

1. [why-did-you-render](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render#readme)

why-did-you-render by Welldone Software monkey patches React to notify you about potentially avoidable re-renders.

For example, if you pass `style={{width: '100%'}}` to a big pure component, it would always re-render on every element creation.

2. [react-lazyload](https://github.com/twobin/react-lazyload)

Lazy load your component, image or anything that matters the performance.

3. [Plasmic](https://github.com/plasmicapp/plasmic)

![](https://site-assets.plasmic.app/642cae58c19cd41e74e958f311dd9423.png)

The visual web design tool and frontend builder that works with your codebase.

4. [Etherpad](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite)

![](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/raw/develop/doc/images/etherpad_demo.gif)

A modern real-time collaborative document editor.

5. [IceCream](https://github.com/gruns/icecream)

```python
from icecream import ic

def foo(i):
    return i + 333

ic(foo(123))
# ic| foo(123): 456
```

A Python package that helps the developers to debug their Python code. Icecream helps developers get rid of writing multiple prints and log statements to fix the bug while debugging.

## Resources

1. [4 pre-commit Plugins to Automate Code Reviewing and Formatting in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-pre-commit-plugins-to-automate-code-reviewing-and-formatting-in-python-c80c6d2e9f5)

This article will learn what pre-commit is and which plugins you can add to a pre-commit pipeline.

- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): a code formatter in Python.
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): a python tool that checks the style and quality of your Python code. It checks for various issues not covered by black.
- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort): a Python library that automatically sorts imported libraries alphabetically and separates them into sections and types.
- [interrogate](https://interrogate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html?highlight=pre-commit) checks your codebase for missing docstrings.

## Comments

1.  The future will not fit the containers of the past. However, the future, while challenging for some, is likely to be much better for most.
    --[The Four Questions: How Will The Future Be?](https://rishad.substack.com/p/the-four-questions-how-will-the-future)

2.  My biggest mistake, which I made, again and again, was not leaving a job when it was time. I thought I had something to prove, but there was never any point to it. You don't owe anything to an employer. You can't prove anything to an employer. They have no loyalty to you and are careless than nothing about what is right or wrong, wise or foolish.
    So: If you ever think things might not turn out as well as you hoped, move on. There is so much else going on in the world that is at least as enjoyable as what you are doing, where you have a much better chance of making a difference, that spending time on things that you might not end up proud of is a terrible waste of your short time on Earth.

3.  Novice writers try to sound intelligent, professional writers try to write clearly, and masters try to communicate emotions that stir the reader's soul.

4.  Startup founders need to do two things: (1) figure out what to do, (2) do it. My beef with "move fast" is that I don't naturally associate it with figuring out what to do. If I spent a day thinking, trying to understand a problem better, I wouldn't view myself as having "moved fast" that day.
