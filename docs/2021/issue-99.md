1. [Climate Change 2021](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/)

![](https://redgreenandblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Drivers-of-observed-warming-over-1850-2020-IPCC.jpg)

Here are five key takeaways from the report:

- Many changes to our planet are accelerating, unprecedented and irreversible
- Human influence on the climate system is the main driver of changes
- We may cross the 1.5C threshold earlier than expected
- Every increment of warming matters, and we can't rule out potentially catastrophic events
- We know what we need to do, and the earlier we act, the better

2. [Marine Traffic Map](https://www.marinetraffic.com/)

Every one of the Marine Traffic Live Map's small green and red arrows belongs to either a cargo ship or a tanker. And each one is operated by a team of people that support our 21st-century lifestyles.

According to ICS data, about 1.6 million people work aboard international commerce ships. As a result, life at sea may be hazardous and lonely for them.

## AI

John Deere agreed to pay $250 million for Bear Flag Robotics, a California startup that upgrades conventional tractors for full autonomy.

**Why it matters**: In addition to helping the farmers deal with a long-running labour shortage, AI-driven equipment could help increase their productivity and limit environmental impacts such as pesticide runoff.

**How it works**: Deere has offered GPS-enabled tractor guidance systems that aid a human driver for nearly two decades. Bear Flag has adapted self-driving technology developed by the automotive industry to help tractors roam agricultural fields safely without a driver.

Self-driving cars aren't yet commonly used on public roads, but the technology appears to be good enough for commercial use in constrained environments like farms.

## Research

1. [Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL)](http://darbelofflab.mit.edu/robotics-research/supernumerary-robotic-limbs-srl/)

![](http://darbelofflab.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Slide1-1024x453.jpg)

The Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) is a wearable robot that provides a human user with two additional robotic arms. The SRL is being used to assist wearers in complex tasks, compensate for their weight while working in uncomfortable positions, and augment their balance during walking.

## Comments

1. Stewardship is a more effective mindset than rules-based, authority-based governance. It reminds us we are working collectively to improve and tend, rather than dictating what will be.

2. Governance is a process where you ask other people for permission to do things and the governing body serves to enforce consistency in things.
   Stewardship is much more collaborative process and involves tending to what exists, guiding rather than dictating what will be.

3. We extract far too little benefit from our current implementation of GraphQL today, as it is rife with anti-patterns, duplication of types and an inconsistent application of GraphQL conventions. No formal GraphQL team or support mechanisms are seen"
   --[Quote from major e-commerce company](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/community/graphql-champions/10-best-practices-for-schema-stewardship/)

4. The measure of a GraphQL schema's fitness is its value to clients. It's crucial to remind schema authors their goal is to provide service, not just provide access to their service.
